# Tandem TUI Guide

The Tandem TUI (Terminal User Interface) provides a lightweight, keyboard-driven way to interact with the Tandem Engine.

## Running the TUI

To run the TUI, you must be in the `tandem` directory of the project.

```bash
cargo run -p tandem-tui
```

### Connectivity Options

The TUI can interact with the Tandem Engine in two ways:

1. **Existing Instance**: If an engine is already running (e.g., from the desktop app or another terminal), the TUI will attempt to connect to it.
2. **Auto-Spawn**: If no engine is detected, the TUI will attempt to bootstrap and spawn a local engine process automatically.

## Startup Experience

On startup, you will see a short Matrix-style animation. You can skip this by pressing `Enter`, `Esc`, or `Space` once the engine bootstrap is ready.

### PIN Unlock

The TUI requires a **User PIN** to decrypt your locally stored provider keys (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic keys).

- Enter your PIN when prompted.
- The input is masked for security.
- Once decrypted, your provider credentials are loaded into memory and synced with the engine.
