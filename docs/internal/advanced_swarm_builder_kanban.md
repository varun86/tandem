# Advanced Swarm Builder Kanban

Last updated: 2026-03-10
Source plan: `docs/internal/advanced_swarm_builder_plan.md`

## Slice Goal
Ship an advanced power-user mission compiler that lets operators define one coordinated swarm mission with shared mission context, role-based workstreams, explicit handoffs, per-lane model/template selection, hard approval gates, operator kill switches, and recoverable failure handling, while keeping the existing simple automation wizard intact.

## In Progress
- [ ] None

## Remaining Follow-Up
- [~] P0: Tighten the mission kill switch semantics beyond cancel labeling:
  - [x] distinguish `operator_stopped` vs `guardrail_stopped` vs `cancelled` in run state
  - [x] surface stop reason in list view, run detail, and diagnostics/history
  - [x] cancel tracked active sessions and tracked active instances on stop
  - [ ] confirm and harden immediate halt semantics for any remaining untracked session/instance paths
- [ ] P0: Add continue/recovery flow after operator pause, not just failed-run recovery.
  - [x] paused runs resume cleanly
  - [x] operator can recover from pause with explicit intent
  - [ ] downstream state remains coherent under more complex multi-branch scenarios
  - [x] UI clearly shows resumed vs recovered through lifecycle/detail fields
- [ ] P1: Harden advanced automation edit compatibility across older or partially-populated records.
  - [x] unsupported legacy records fall back gracefully
  - [x] older mission-blueprint metadata variants hydrate safely
  - [x] reconstruct usable advanced drafts from sparse compiled automation metadata when authored mission metadata is missing
- [ ] P1: Add PM semantics to the authored mission/workflow model.
  - [x] define authored `priority`, `phase`, `lane`, and `milestone` semantics
  - keep dependencies as the legality constraint
  - define scheduler behavior:
    - [x] `phase` controls what work is currently open
    - [x] `priority` orders runnable work
    - [x] `lane` supports grouping, visualization, and optional concurrency shaping
    - [x] `milestone` / gates control promotion into later stages
  - [x] decide compile-time vs runtime ownership for phase/milestone behavior
  - [x] update compiler/runtime metadata while keeping `AutomationV2Spec` as the execution target
  - [x] update scheduler selection logic so phase + priority influence execution without violating dependencies
  - [x] expose phase/lane/priority/milestone grouping in the advanced builder UI and compile preview
  - [x] add validation for bad phase references, invalid milestone structure, and illegal barrier sequencing
  - [ ] refine phase-open semantics beyond barrier compilation and runnable ordering
  - [x] add deeper milestone-specific runtime observability and promotion diagnostics
    current state: milestone promotions are now recorded into lifecycle history as structured promotion events and surfaced in the run inspector alongside phase/milestone progress and blocker context
- [ ] P1: Surface full operator diagnostics in the run inspector:
  - [x] gate history
  - [x] per-step logs
    current state: backend-native node lifecycle events now supplement transcript-derived step logs with structured start / completion / failure records
  - [x] transcripts
  - [x] recovery history
  - [x] blocked-node reasons
  - [x] visible failure chain
- [ ] P2: Add step-level repair flow so an operator can:
  - [x] edit an individual failed step
  - [x] patch the prompt
  - [x] change template/model assignment
  - [x] rerun only the affected subtree
  - [x] keep richer repair history and prompt-diff visibility
- [ ] P2: Add stronger visual dependency graph for workstreams, fan-out, and fan-in in the compile tab.
  - [x] add phase-grouped graph preview in the compile tab
  - [x] add stronger topology rendering with lane grouping, fan-in/fan-out summaries, and explicit upstream/downstream handoff chips
- [ ] Add richer validation warnings for:
  - [x] unreachable terminal stages not captured by milestone or approval promotion
  - [x] suspicious fan-in/fan-out
  - [x] redundant input refs
  - [x] template/model mismatches
  - [x] align PM-semantics validation with the P1 phase/lane/milestone slice so warnings do not drift from the authored model
- [x] Add more executor regression coverage around mission control/recovery semantics.
  - [x] cover gate rework subtree reset and stale downstream output invalidation
  - [x] cover step repair subtree reset and persisted prompt/template diffs
  - [x] cover paused-run recovery continuity without clearing completed upstream state
  - [x] cover failed-branch recovery preserving completed sibling branches in a multi-branch graph
  - [x] cover paused-run recovery preserving sibling-branch state in a multi-branch graph
  - [x] cover branch-local gate rework preserving completed sibling branches
  - [x] cover branch-local step repair preserving completed sibling branches
  - [x] cover operator stop semantics, stop-kind recording, and active session/instance cleanup
  - [x] move remaining halt-path uncertainty under the P0 kill-switch hardening item instead of leaving it as vague regression work
- [x] Add integration coverage that exercises mission-builder preview/apply through the Tauri boundary.
  - [x] cover `mission_builder_preview` posting `/mission-builder/compile-preview`
  - [x] cover `mission_builder_apply` posting `/mission-builder/apply`
- [x] Decide compiler ownership for mission-builder logic.
  - [x] keep authored mission normalization, validation, PM-semantics expansion, and `AutomationV2Spec` compilation in `tandem-workflows`
  - [x] keep apply-time persistence, run-now behavior, and transport shaping in server / Tauri layers
- [x] Improve advanced editing for multiple review/test stages and per-workstream tool/MCP scope controls.
  - [x] support multiple review / test / approval stages in the advanced builder editor
  - [x] support per-workstream tool and MCP scope overrides in the editor
  - [x] support per-stage tool and MCP scope overrides in the editor
- [x] Improve the per-step scope editor UX beyond CSV entry:
  - [x] searchable tool selection
  - [x] MCP multi-select from discovered servers
  - [x] clearer inheritance vs override display
- [x] Add edit/migration support for advanced automations from the automations list, not only new creation flow.
  - [x] route mission-blueprint automations from the list into the advanced editor
  - [x] hydrate older advanced metadata variants when editing from the list

## Explicitly Out Of Scope
- [ ] Replacing `AutomationV2` with a separate parallel runtime for the advanced builder
- [ ] Removing the existing simple automation wizard
- [ ] Making the feature software-development-specific
- [ ] Fully custom runtime semantics outside validated graph compilation

## Risks
- The advanced builder now compiles into the existing `AutomationV2` runtime, which keeps architecture aligned, but some advanced semantics are still represented through metadata and prompt inheritance rather than a deeper dedicated mission runtime.
- Approval gating is implemented as a hard runtime pause point, but operator recovery tooling is still incomplete until failed-step editing, continue flow, and richer gate/rework history are fully exposed.
- Backend guardrails and basic operator stop controls now exist, but the UI still needs sharper distinctions between cancellation, guardrail stop, pause/resume, and repaired recovery paths.
- Without first-class PM semantics, the system can know what is runnable but still fail to express what should go first, what phase the mission is in, or why later work remains intentionally deprioritized or gated.
- The compile preview is structurally useful today, but the graph visualization is still weaker than the product ambition for a power-user swarm mission builder.

## Notes
- The execution target remains `AutomationV2Spec`, not `MissionSpec`.
- `MissionSpec`/`WorkItem` are currently derived preview/interop artifacts, not the primary runtime contract.
- The simple wizard remains the default low-friction path; the advanced builder is additive.
- The operator model needs to be first-class:
  - stop the mission fast when it is going wrong
  - understand exactly why it failed
  - edit the failing step
  - continue from a repaired state
- The most important shipped semantic change is explicit mission inheritance:
  - mission title
  - mission goal
  - success criteria
  - shared context
  - local assignment
  - dependency context
- Next strategic semantic gap:
  - dependencies already explain legality
  - the model still needs priority, phase, lane, and milestone semantics to explain orchestration intent
