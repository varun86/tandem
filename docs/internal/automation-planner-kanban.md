# Automation Planner Kanban

## Slice Goal
Ship the smallest correct engine-first automation creation path:

`prompt -> workflow-plans preview/apply -> AutomationV2Spec -> runtime execution`

This board is a burn-down board for the current slice only.
It is not a wishlist for future planner features.

## Ship Blockers
- [x] Run a targeted backend verification pass after clearing unrelated test compile failures
- [x] Fix regressions found by that verification pass
- [x] Explicitly flag the current deterministic planner-chat revision surface as limited in the UI

## In Progress
- [x] Keep the kanban scoped to ship-blocking work only
- [x] Current slice has no remaining ship blockers

## Done In This Slice
- [x] Add canonical backend planner endpoints:
  - `POST /workflow-plans/preview`
  - `POST /workflow-plans/apply`
- [x] Compile planner output into `AutomationV2Spec`
- [x] Persist planner metadata on created V2 automations
- [x] Add additive V2 dataflow fields:
  - `input_refs`
  - `output_contract`
- [x] Persist canonical node outputs for downstream consumption
- [x] Inject deterministic upstream outputs into downstream node execution
- [x] Keep legacy `/automations` compatible during migration
- [x] Move the Automations page off legacy `/automations` creation and onto planner preview/apply
- [x] Seed the planner path from chat/setup interception
- [x] Make `workspace_root` a first-class planner/apply/runtime field
- [x] Validate `workspace_root` on planner preview/apply and direct `/automations/v2` create/patch
- [x] Fail V2 runs clearly when an explicit `workspace_root` does not exist
- [x] Fail V2 runs clearly when an explicit `workspace_root` is not a directory
- [x] Unblock targeted backend verification by fixing unrelated `coder.rs` test compile regressions
- [x] Carry allowed MCP server constraints through planner/apply into agent MCP policy
- [x] Add in-memory workflow plan drafts and planning conversations
- [x] Add planning draft routes:
  - `POST /workflow-plans/chat/start`
  - `POST /workflow-plans/chat/message`
  - `POST /workflow-plans/chat/reset`
  - `GET /workflow-plans/:plan_id`
- [x] Add planning chat UI to the Automations review step
- [x] Explicitly label the planning chat surface as limited in this slice
- [x] Surface planner change summaries and clarifier feedback in the review UI
- [x] Return explicit supported-edit guidance when planner-chat receives an unsupported revision note
- [x] Preserve advanced create settings as backend-owned `operator_preferences`
- [x] Compile execution-mode and model preferences into V2 execution/model policy
- [x] Keep the review summary aligned with the latest revised workflow plan
- [x] Remove pack-builder-first wording from the default automation creation flow
- [x] Clarify the optional scaffold section as a reusable-skill export path, not the default flow
- [x] Allow apply to optionally export a reusable Pack Builder draft after planning
- [x] Show explicit cleared states in review:
  - `Workspace default` for cleared model override
  - `None` for cleared MCP constraints
- [x] Show the latest planned step list in review
- [x] Add explicit planner-model controls in the Automations wizard so broader planner fallback can be enabled without editing raw role-model JSON
- [x] Require planner-model fallback to be fully specified:
  - block half-filled planner-model config in the wizard
  - strip incomplete `role_models.planner` values in backend normalization
- [x] Add planner-chat deterministic revisions for:
  - schedule updates
  - switching back to manual execution
  - title updates
  - workspace root updates
  - safe workflow-shape switching
    Current shapes: single-step, compare/report, research/report, notification
  - input-collection step add/remove
  - analysis-step add/remove
  - MCP add/remove/clear
  - MCP `only` narrowing semantics
  - notification-step add/remove
  - execution mode / max parallel updates
  - model override set/clear
  - planner model override set/clear
  - terminal output-style updates:
    structured JSON, markdown, summary, URLs, citations
- [x] Bound planner LLM fallback with a backend timeout and return a specific clarifier when broader planner revision cannot produce a valid workflow update
- [x] Fast-fail planner LLM fallback when the requested planner-model provider is not configured on the engine, with a specific clarifier instead of entering the runtime path
- [x] Show broader planner-revision availability explicitly in review instead of leaving it implicit in planner-model fields and clarifiers
- [x] Promote planner chat to a true engine-owned LLM-backed revision loop when a planner model is configured, with validated deterministic fallback as the safety net

## Deferred After This Slice
- [~] Add optional export/persistence to Pack Builder after planning
- Current state: `POST /workflow-plans/apply` accepts optional `pack_builder_export` and can persist a Pack Builder preview for pending/apply follow-ups.
- [~] Expand planner-chat semantics beyond the current safe deterministic field set
- Current state: with a planner model configured, the LLM revision path can now rewrite mixed workflow graphs across the expanded fixed step catalog, including step objectives, dependencies, input refs, schedules, and output contracts. The current catalog now includes richer research/synthesis steps like `extract_pain_points`, `cluster_topics`, and `compare_with_features`. Remaining follow-up is about going broader than the current fixed engine-owned step catalog, not about staying inside the deterministic presets.
- [x] Further polish the reusable-skill export UI so it reads as a prompt-based secondary export path and warns when the draft may be stale relative to later planner-chat revisions

## Explicitly Out Of Scope For This Slice
- [ ] Dynamic replanning during runtime execution
- [ ] Large typed artifact/data contract framework
- [ ] Planner memory system beyond existing automation/runtime persistence
- [ ] Replacing legacy `/automations` all at once

## Risks
- The current planner-chat layer now has a true LLM-backed revision path, but its deterministic safety net still covers a bounded field and shape set.
- We ran targeted backend verification for this slice, but not an exhaustive full-suite sweep.

## Notes
- New work should only enter `Ship Blockers` if it blocks the current engine-first migration slice from shipping.
- Everything else belongs in `Deferred After This Slice` or a separate future-planning document.
- Current status: the engine-first automation creation slice is ready for handoff; remaining items are deferred follow-up work around planner breadth, not planner ownership or contract shape.
