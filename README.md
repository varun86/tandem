Inspired by [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview), but open source and provider-agnostic.

## Why Tandem?

**🔒 Privacy First**: Unlike cloud-based AI tools, Tandem runs on your machine. Your code, documents, and API keys never touch our servers because we don't have any.

**💰 Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**: Use any LLM provider - don't get locked into one vendor. Switch between OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, or run models locally with Ollama.

**🛡️ Zero Trust**: Every file operation requires explicit approval. AI agents are powerful but Tandem treats them as "untrusted contractors" with supervised access.

**🌐 True Cross-Platform**: Native apps for Windows, macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon), and Linux. No Electron bloat - built on Tauri for fast, lightweight performance.

**📖 Open Source**: MIT licensed. Review the code, contribute features, or fork it for your needs.

## Developer Superpowers for Everyone

In 2024, AI coding tools like Cursor and Claude Code transformed how developers work - letting them interact with entire codebases, automate complex tasks, and review changes before they happen.

**But why should only programmers have these capabilities?**

- Researchers need to synthesize hundreds of papers
- Writers need consistency across sprawling manuscripts
- Analysts need to cross-reference quarterly reports
- Administrators need to organize mountains of documents

Tandem brings the same transformative capabilities to everyone. Point it at any folder of files, and you get:

- **Folder-wide intelligence** - AI that understands your entire collection, not just one file
- **Multi-step automation** - Complex tasks broken into reviewable steps
- **Visual change review** - See exactly what will change before it happens
- **Complete undo** - Roll back any operation with one click

What Cursor did for developers, Tandem does for everyone.

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (recommended) or npm

**Platform-specific:**

| Platform | Additional Requirements                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Windows  | [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) |
| macOS    | Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`                             |
| Linux    | `webkit2gtk-4.1`, `libappindicator3`, `librsvg2`                               |

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/frumu-ai/tandem.git
   cd tandem
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Download the sidecar binary**

   ```bash
   pnpm run download-sidecar
   ```

   This fetches the OpenCode binary for your platform.

4. **Run in development mode**
   ```bash
   pnpm tauri dev
   ```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build for current platform
pnpm tauri build

# Output locations:
# Windows: src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/
# macOS:   src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/
# Linux:   src-tauri/target/release/bundle/appimage/
```

## Configuration

### Setting Up Your LLM Provider

Tandem supports multiple LLM providers. Configure them in Settings:

1. Launch Tandem
2. Click the **Settings** icon (gear) in the sidebar
3. Choose and configure your provider:

**Supported Providers:**

| Provider          | Description                                      | Get API Key                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OpenRouter** ⭐ | Access 100+ models through one API (recommended) | [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)                     |
| **OpenCode Zen**  | Fast, cost-effective models optimized for coding | [opencode.ai/zen](https://opencode.ai/zen)                           |
| **Anthropic**     | Claude models (Sonnet, Opus, Haiku)              | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) |
| **OpenAI**        | GPT-4, GPT-3.5 and other OpenAI models           | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)          |
| **Ollama**        | Run models locally (no API key needed)           | [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)                                     |
| **Custom**        | Any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint               | Configure endpoint URL                                               |

4. Enter your API key - it's encrypted with AES-256-GCM and stored securely in the local vault
5. (Optional) Configure model preferences and endpoints

### Granting Folder Access

Tandem operates on a **zero-trust model** - it can only access folders you explicitly grant permission to:

1. Click **Projects** in the sidebar
2. Click **+ New Project** or **Select Workspace**
3. Choose a folder via the native file picker
4. Tandem can now read/write files in that folder (with your approval)

You can manage multiple projects and switch between them easily. Each project maintains its own:

- Chat history
- Permission settings
- File access scope

```

**Tech Stack:**

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Rust, Tauri 2.0
- **Agent Runtime**: OpenCode CLI (TypeScript-based sidecar)
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for API key storage
- **IPC**: Tauri's secure command system

### Supervised Agent Pattern

Tandem treats the AI as an "untrusted contractor":

- All operations go through a **Tool Proxy**
- Write operations require **user approval**
- Full **operation journal** with undo capability
- **Circuit breaker** for resilience
- **Execution Planning** - Review all changes as a batch before applying

#### Plan Mode vs Immediate Mode

Tandem offers two modes for handling AI operations:

**Immediate Mode** (default):

- Approve each file change individually via toast notifications
- Good for quick, small changes
- Traditional AI assistant experience

**Plan Mode** (recommended for complex tasks):

- Toggle with the **"Plan Mode"** button in the chat header
- Uses OpenCode's native Plan agent
- AI proposes file operations that are staged for review
- All changes appear in the **Execution Plan panel** (bottom-right)
- Review diffs side-by-side before applying
- Remove unwanted operations
- Execute all approved changes with one click

**How to use Plan Mode:**

1. Click "Immediate" → "Plan Mode" toggle in header
2. Ask AI to make changes (e.g., "Refactor the auth system")
3. AI proposes operations → they appear in Execution Plan panel
4. Review diffs and operations
5. Click **"Execute Plan"** button in panel
6. All changes applied together + AI continues

The Execution Plan panel appears automatically when the AI proposes file changes in Plan Mode.

- Full undo support for the entire batch

Toggle between modes using the button in the chat header.

## Security

Tandem is built with security and privacy as core principles:

- **🔐 API keys**: Encrypted with AES-256-GCM in SecureKeyStore, never stored in plaintext
- **📁 File access**: Scoped to user-selected directories only - zero-trust model
- **🌐 Network**: Only connects to localhost (sidecar) + user-configured LLM endpoints
- **🚫 No telemetry**: Zero analytics, zero tracking, zero call home
- **✅ Code-signed releases**: All installers are signed for security (Windows, macOS)
- **🔒 Sandboxed**: Tauri security model with CSP and permission system
- **💾 Local-first**: All data stays on your machine unless sent to your LLM provider

**Denied by default:**

- `.env` files and environment variables
- `.pem`, `.key` files
- SSH keys (`.ssh/*`)
- Secrets folders
- Password databases

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for our complete security model and threat analysis.

**Tandem** - Your local-first AI coworker.

_Note: This codebase communicates with the OpenCode sidecar binary for AI agent capabilities and routes to various LLM providers (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, or custom APIs). All communication stays local except for LLM provider API calls._
