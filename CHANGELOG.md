# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.5] - Released 2026-05-05

### Added

- **Session records now carry explicit source metadata**: Engine sessions can now record `source_kind` and `source_metadata`, with wire responses and TypeScript client types exposing the same data. New user-created sessions default to `chat`, while automation-owned runtime sessions can be classified separately.

### Fixed

- **Automation worker sessions no longer appear as Chat conversations**: Chat and Dashboard recent-session lists now request `source=chat`, and the server filters session listings by source. Existing legacy records titled like `Automation ... / ...` are classified as `automation_v2` at the storage/wire boundary, keeping Bug Monitor and Automation V2 audit sessions inspectable through automation/run surfaces without polluting the Chat session picker.
- **Tauri calendar view no longer crashes during startup**: The Automation Calendar now loads FullCalendar after the Tauri/WebKit stylesheet host is ready and keeps FullCalendar in a lazy chunk, avoiding a WebKit timing crash where FullCalendar accessed `style.sheet.cssRules` while the stylesheet was still `null`.

## [0.5.4] - Released 2026-05-05

### Added

- **Workflow packs are now the default workflow sharing format**: Planner sessions can be exported as marketplace-ready `.zip` packs containing `tandempack.yaml`, `README.md`, an embedded workflow plan bundle, and an optional cover image. The Workflows page now prioritizes pack upload/preview/install and keeps raw JSON bundle import available as an advanced fallback.
- **Workflow pack import/export APIs and SDK helpers**: Added `/workflow-plans/export/pack`, `/workflow-plans/import/pack/preview`, and `/workflow-plans/import/pack`, plus TypeScript client helpers for exporting workflow packs and previewing/importing workflow pack ZIPs.
- **Hosted-safe workflow pack downloads**: Workflow pack exports now include a download URL, and the Workflows page renders a browser Download ZIP action so hosted users do not need filesystem access to retrieve generated packs.
- **Workflow pack provenance**: Imported workflow-pack sessions now retain pack identity and version metadata alongside the source bundle digest, making installed workflow origins inspectable after import.

### Changed

- **Pack manifest reference validation understands cover images**: Pack marketplace metadata can now reference `marketplace.listing.cover_image`, and workflow pack import previews render supported PNG, JPEG, and WebP covers with size/path validation.

### Fixed

- **Automation cron schedules preserve local wall-clock time**: Runtime scheduling now accepts the 5-field cron expressions emitted by the control panel and normalizes them for the server cron parser before computing `next_fire_at_ms`. Cron schedules are evaluated in the saved IANA timezone, with a Budapest weekday 9:00 AM regression test covering DST-aware wall-clock behavior.
- **Automation schedule UI carries timezone context**: Guided schedule summaries, creation review, workflow editing, automation calendar labels, and standup scheduling now display and save against the selected timezone instead of implying UTC. `Europe/Budapest` is now included in the common timezone picker.
- **Research-synthesis workflows no longer require unrelated workspace reads**: Final report/brief nodes that synthesize upstream MCP, Reddit, web, and run-artifact evidence no longer inherit `local_source_reads` as a hard requirement. This prevents concise research-to-Notion workflows from blocking with `research brief cited workspace sources without using read` when the workflow never needed repository source files.
- **Existing saved synthesis nodes tolerate stale read enforcement**: Runtime validation now treats stale `local_source_reads`/`read` requirements as advisory for `research_synthesis` nodes, while preserving strict `read` enforcement for code workflows, local research, and Bug Monitor/source-inspection tasks that genuinely require repo evidence.
- **Control-panel uploads use the global Tandem data directory**: Panel-managed uploads now prefer `$TANDEM_HOME/data/channel_uploads`, expand `~`, `$HOME`, `${HOME}`, and `%HOME%`, and normalize Windows-style separators on Linux/macOS so uploaded workflow pack images do not create stray literal `%HOME%\...` directories in the repo.

## [0.5.3] - Released 2026-05-03

### Changed

- **Automation V2 definitions are stored as per-workflow shards**: Saved workflow definitions now persist under `data/automations-v2/<automation-id>.json` with a small index instead of rewriting every workflow into one growing `automations_v2.json` aggregate. Existing aggregate files are migrated on load and archived as `automations_v2.legacy-aggregate.json`.
- **Generated workflow planning uses deterministic task-budget compaction**: AI-generated workflow plans now have a hard 8-step budget. Oversized planner output is compacted into request-aware macro steps before preview or chat-revision storage, preserving source/tool intent and destinations such as Notion collection ids instead of falling back to a generic `execute_goal` plan. Manual Studio workflows and explicit imports remain exempt.
- **Planner diagnostics expose task-budget status**: Preview/revision diagnostics now include `task_budget.max_generated_steps`, `generated_step_count`, `status`, and `original_step_count` when compaction occurs; the control panel surfaces messages such as “Planner compacted 29 generated tasks into 6 runnable workflow steps.”

### Fixed

- **Connector-backed workflow nodes receive their actual MCP tools**: Natural node objectives such as “Use the connected Reddit MCP” now match hyphenated MCP server ids such as `reddit-gmail`, so generated research nodes request `mcp.reddit_gmail.*` instead of being offered only `mcp_list` and local file tools.
- **Research artifacts no longer self-block on connector limitations**: Artifact prompts and repair guidance now tell agents to record unavailable connectors or partial evidence under limitation fields while keeping finished JSON artifacts terminal (`status: completed`), preventing `artifact_status_not_terminal` loops that stop downstream workflow and Bug Monitor reporting.
- **Apply/session boundaries reject runaway generated plans**: `/workflow-plans/apply` and planner-session creation reject over-budget generated plans with `WORKFLOW_PLAN_TASK_BUDGET_EXCEEDED` if an uncompacted oversized plan reaches them.

## [0.5.2] - Released 2026-05-03

### Changed

- **Bug Monitor triage evidence is advisory, not report-blocking**: Automation V2-backed Bug Monitor triage still asks agents to search the configured repo and prefer concrete source `read` evidence, but missing or inconclusive reads no longer hard-block Bug Monitor's own inspection/research/validation/fix artifacts. This keeps GitHub reporting focused on the original workflow failure instead of recursively failing on `no_concrete_reads`.
- **Bug Monitor blocked triage can still publish fallback evidence**: Blocked Bug Monitor triage Automation V2 runs are now treated as terminal enough for fallback summary synthesis and GitHub publication, so issue drafts can preserve the real workflow failure even when triage cannot satisfy every evidence preference.
- **Generated compact research-to-destination workflows stay compact**: The workflow planner now recognizes concise research/report/save prompts, caps them around 5-8 leaf tasks, avoids splitting every report section into its own node, and rejects over-budget LLM plans in favor of a compact fallback.
- **Connector-backed inspection and research nodes get the long workflow budget**: Structured JSON nodes that inspect or fetch external sources such as Notion collections, Reddit, or web research now inherit the long-running workflow timeout instead of the generic 180-second structured JSON default.

### Fixed

- **Bug Monitor no longer masks workflow failures with its own source-read gate**: Triage artifacts now use artifact-only validation and preserve tool/search limitations in completed JSON instead of blocking issue publication when an agent searches but does not produce a concrete `read` receipt.
- **Notion collection inspection nodes no longer default to 3-minute timeouts**: Generated workflow nodes such as `inspect_notion_collection` that call external data sources now receive the long-running automation budget, reducing premature `automation node ... timed out after 180000 ms` failures.

## [0.5.1] - Released 2026-05-03

### Added

- **Bug Monitor external project log intake**: Added monitored-project/log-source config, deterministic JSON-lines and plaintext log parsing, persisted offset state, evidence artifact writing, storm control, and a background watcher that turns local external project log failures into Bug Monitor incidents without requiring a workflow to hold the full engine token.
- **Scoped Bug Monitor external report intake**: Added limited per-project intake keys plus `POST /bug-monitor/intake/report` and `/failure-reporter/intake/report` so CI systems and external apps can submit normalized failure reports without access to the full engine API token.
- **Bug Monitor intake-key management APIs**: Added protected key list/create/disable endpoints under `/bug-monitor/intake/keys`, storing only key hashes and returning raw keys only at creation.
- **Bug Monitor log evidence artifacts**: Added state-managed `tandem://bug-monitor/...` evidence refs and JSON evidence artifacts for log candidates, including byte offsets, source ids, redacted excerpts, and fingerprints.

### Changed

- **Bug Monitor triage receives explicit repo-root inputs**: Automation V2-backed Bug Monitor triage nodes now carry the resolved `workspace_root` in node inputs and prompt guidance, making local source reads target the selected repo checkout instead of relying on implicit workspace context.
- **Bug Monitor setup explains hosted repo layout**: The control panel now shows a hosted path map for Bug Monitor, quick actions for `/workspace/repos/<repo>`, setup warnings for parent/runtime-state folders, and Coder sync hints so operators know which checkout Bug Monitor will inspect.
- **Bug Monitor triage is project-aware**: Triage run creation now prefers the linked incident or monitored project `workspace_root`, `model_policy`, and `mcp_server` before falling back to global Bug Monitor config, so external project failures are inspected in the correct repo/workspace.
- **Bug Monitor config supports monitored projects**: The existing single-project/global config remains compatible, while `monitored_projects` can now define external repos, workspace roots, log sources, and project policy.
- **Bug Monitor status exposes watcher health**: Status snapshots now include log watcher running state, enabled project/source counts, source health, offsets, file size, last poll/candidate/submission times, and source errors.

### Fixed

- **Bug Monitor research retries missing concrete reads more reliably**: Triage research now gets an additional repair attempt when it searches the repo but fails to perform the required concrete source-file `read`, reducing blocked `no_concrete_reads` demo failures.
- **External log paths fail closed**: Monitored log paths are validated under their configured workspace root, including symlink/absolute path escape rejection, before watcher polling.
- **Split log lines keep correct evidence offsets**: Partial trailing lines now preserve their starting byte offset so failures spanning polls produce accurate evidence ranges.
- **External project dedupe avoids cross-repo collisions**: Watcher-created incidents dedupe by `repo + fingerprint` instead of fingerprint alone.

## [0.5.0] - Released 2026-05-03

### Added

- **Bug Monitor GitHub fallback body evidence policy**: Added bounded evidence rendering for fallback Bug Monitor issue bodies so failed triage and timed-out runs still produce actionable GitHub artifacts. Fallback bodies now include capped logs, evidence references, diagnostic metadata, triage signal quality details, and explicit triage status markers when the issue is posted without LLM-rendered content.
- **Automation V2-backed Bug Monitor triage**: Bug Monitor triage runs now launch as Automation V2 runs instead of orphaned context runs, preserving the inspect/research/validate/fix-proposal graph while using the same scheduler and executor as saved workflows.
- **Bug Monitor triage artifact adapter**: Automation V2 triage node outputs are mirrored into the global Bug Monitor context-run artifact registry so issue drafting can consume inspection, research, validation, and fix-proposal artifacts without relying on workspace-local run files.
- **Managed worktree cleanup API, CLI, SDK, and Settings panel**: Added `POST /api/engine/worktree/cleanup`, `tandem-engine storage worktrees`, TS/Python SDK cleanup helpers, and a new `Settings -> Maintenance` control-panel surface that previews and removes stale repo-local managed worktrees under `.tandem/worktrees`, animates scan/removal progress, reports exactly what was deleted or skipped, and also prunes orphaned leftover directories.
- **Coder run visibility in the shared control panel**: The former Coding surface is now presented as Coder, with an overview card for active ACA-supervised Coder runs, status/phase/error details, and operator actions to reconcile or cancel long-running repository work through the existing ACA proxy.

### Changed

- **Evidence caps over raw payload dumps**: `build_issue_body` now enforces bounded rendering budgets for logs, evidence refs, tool evidence rows, and quality-gate fields in fallback GitHub issue drafts, while preserving full evidence in incident/draft artifacts for detailed investigation.
- **Bug Monitor triage now requires repo evidence**: Triage node objectives and output guidance now require a local repository evidence pass using fast `codesearch`, `grep`, `glob`, and `read` tools, and artifacts must carry searched terms, files examined, file references, likely edit points, affected components, tool evidence, uncertainty, and bounded next steps where available.
- **Completed Bug Monitor triage now finalizes automatically**: Completed Automation V2-backed triage runs now synthesize the triage summary, regenerate the issue draft, and retry the normal GitHub publish path instead of leaving drafts stuck at `triage_pending`.
- **Stale MCP server names are no longer fatal by default**: Automation V2 treats renamed or missing policy-selected MCP server names as stale configuration warnings, expands discovery to currently enabled servers, and lets the agent inspect actual available tools through `mcp_list`. Existing disconnected or disabled servers still fail fast as real connector readiness problems.
- **Bug Monitor triage artifacts are global context-run artifacts**: Triage nodes now return structured JSON handoffs that Tandem stores under the global context-run artifact store, while project workspaces remain evidence sources instead of required Bug Monitor artifact destinations.
- **Workflow execute nodes get a long-running budget**: Generated workflow `execute` / `execute_goal` nodes now materialize with a 30-minute timeout, and legacy saved `execute_goal` nodes without explicit `timeout_ms` inherit the same long-running budget instead of the generic 3-minute structured-JSON default. Operators can tune this with `TANDEM_AUTOMATION_EXECUTE_NODE_TIMEOUT_MS`.

### Fixed

- **Reduced empty/opaque fallback issue posts**: Bug Monitor posts now avoid near-empty bodies in retry/timeouts by including structured sections from existing `BugMonitorDraftRecord` and `BugMonitorIncidentRecord` fields (including logs, evidence refs, run/session/correlation metadata, and triage status), helping reviewers triage incidents without needing external reconstruction.
- **Bug Monitor triage no longer sits forever in context-run planning**: Triage now has a real executor behind it, and timeout diagnostics understand both new Automation V2-backed triage runs and legacy context-run triage IDs.
- **Bug Monitor triage handles stale automation output-contract migrations**: Existing Automation V2 triage runs with older `local_research` inspection contracts are detected and recreated with the new `artifact_only` artifact contract before reuse, preventing one bad persisted run definition from permanently blocking the same draft in non-terminal states.
- **Bug Monitor triage handles legacy enforcement metadata at runtime**: Even when older persisted triage runs bypass the recreated-contract path, inspection nodes now bypass legacy concrete-read gating (`read`, `local_source_reads`, `concrete_reads`, `no_concrete_reads`) so they can continue using the new evidence model and complete without being incorrectly blocked.
- **Bug Monitor triage no longer blocks on workspace artifact files**: Bug Monitor triage nodes no longer require `.tandem/runs/<run_id>/artifacts/bug_monitor.*.json` files, and older persisted triage nodes with `builder.output_path` metadata are treated as global context-artifact nodes instead of workspace artifact writers.
- **Bug Monitor no longer reports workflow node timeouts as vague triage failures**: Deterministic Bug Monitor fallback summaries now preserve `automation node ... timed out after ... ms` evidence, including the node id and timeout budget, so GitHub issues point at the actual workflow failure even when LLM triage cannot finish.
- **Bug Monitor triage env defaults match the 30-minute runtime**: `resolve_bug_monitor_env_config` now falls back to the documented 30-minute triage timeout instead of the older 5-minute value when no env override is set.
- **Automation scheduling avoids duplicate concrete MCP tool contention**: Runnable node selection now avoids launching parallel nodes that require the same explicit concrete `mcp.*` tool, reducing duplicate GitHub/connector calls that can race or spam external systems.
- **Automation V2 tool denylist is enforced**: Node tool policies now remove denylisted tools after allowlist expansion, preventing read/research triage nodes from being offered source-editing tools that the workflow explicitly blocked.
- **Automation V2 metadata artifacts are writable**: Node `metadata.artifacts` now feed the session write policy, matching the prompt contract that treats those paths as outputs to create instead of blocking writes with “no declared output targets.”
- **Guardrail for mis-scoped artifacts**: Root-level `/artifacts/` is ignored as a safety net for any future mis-scoped automation output, while the runtime path fix sends Bug Monitor artifacts to `.tandem`.
- **Stale managed worktrees no longer require manual Git surgery**: Operators can now clean up leaked Git worktrees after blocked, failed, or restarted runs without hand-removing `git worktree` entries and leftover `.tandem/worktrees/*` directories.

### Added

- **Storage cleanup CLI**: Added `tandem-engine storage doctor` and `tandem-engine storage cleanup` with dry-run JSON reports, root JSON migration, context-run cleanup, retention windows, and quarantine support.
- **SDK storage helpers**: Added `client.storage` / `client.storage` helpers in the TypeScript and Python SDKs for engine storage file inspection and legacy repair scans.
- **Context-run archive layout**: Old terminal context runs can now be archived as compressed per-run tarballs under `data/context-runs/archive/YYYY/MM/`, with monthly JSONL indexes and a small hot `data/context-runs/index.json`.
- **Automation V2 run history shards**: Automation run history now writes immutable per-run JSON shards under `data/automation-runs/YYYY/MM/` while keeping the active hot index focused on recent summaries.

### Changed

- **Runtime storage layout moves under `data/`**: Root-level feature JSON now canonicalizes into organized directories such as `data/mcp/`, `data/channels/`, `data/routines/`, `data/bug-monitor/`, `data/actions/`, `data/pack-builder/`, `data/system/`, and `data/workflow-planner/`, with legacy root-file fallback during migration.
- **Large run payloads stay out of hot indexes**: Terminal/stale automation runs drop bulky node outputs and runtime context from the active summary file while detailed records remain available from history shards.
- **Context-run APIs read hot and legacy locations**: Context-run endpoints now prefer the canonical hot directory while still finding legacy root `context_runs` entries during cleanup and migration.
- **Engine startup no longer waits on browser setup**: Browser tool registration moved out of the startup-ready path so Chrome is not launched during ordinary engine startup and browser work is initialized only when needed.
- **Engine testing docs stop the service before rebuilds**: `ENGINE_TESTING.md` now stops the service before rebuilding and installing, and its local cleanup examples call the installed service binary explicitly for developer machines where another `tandem-engine` shim appears earlier on `PATH`.
- **Agent-facing storage maintenance docs**: The guide now documents hot indexes, immutable run history, context-run archives, cleanup commands, and SDK inspection helpers so agents know to clean storage before chasing workflow bugs.

### Fixed

- **Legacy storage files no longer force slow startup scans**: Startup loads canonical files first and only falls back to old root JSON when needed, reducing the chance that stale multi-megabyte legacy files dominate boot.
- **Bug Monitor GitHub readiness self-heals cold MCP state**: Readiness checks reconnect and refresh selected MCP servers before declaring GitHub unavailable after restarts.

## [0.4.45] - Released 2026-04-28

### Performance

- **Lazy JSON rendering across the control panel**: Large JSON payloads throughout the control panel are now deferred behind `<details>` toggles and only serialized with `JSON.stringify` when actually opened. This eliminates the main source of render thrashing on data-heavy pages (Run Debugger, Scope Inspector, Orchestrator, Feed, Dashboard, Coding Workflows, Packs). Affected components: Run Debugger raw-run payload (entire run + context + blackboard), ScopeInspector credential-envelope and runtime-partition per-row arrays, WorkflowArtifactsPanel artifact JSON, WorkflowTaskSignalsPanel validation basis and receipt timeline, WorkflowLiveSessionLogPanel tool payloads and raw events, WorkflowRunTelemetryPanel event details, and page-level always-visible JSON in FeedPage, DashboardPage, CodingWorkflowsPage, OrchestratorPage, WorkflowsPage, and PacksPage.
- **SSE event batching with RAF**: Live-logging SSE handlers in the automation run debugger now batch state updates using a `requestAnimationFrame` buffer instead of calling `setState` on every incoming event, reducing layout work during high-frequency live runs.
- **Blackboard polling eliminated**: The 5-second `refetchInterval` on the workflow context blackboard query (the single heaviest poll — can be 1+ MB) has been replaced with event-driven invalidation triggered from the SSE stream. Other context queries (run, events, patches) drop from 5-second to 30-second safety-net intervals.

### Added

- **Bug Monitor control-panel surface**: Added a real `#/bug-monitor` page for runtime failure triage. Operators can inspect readiness/status, refresh or recompute monitor state, pause/resume/debug the monitor, browse incidents/drafts/posts, replay incidents, create triage runs, approve/deny/recheck/publish drafts, and submit manual issue reports from one surface. The Bug Monitor route is now wired into hash routing and visible by default in ACA mode.
- **Research-backed Bug Monitor triage**: Bug Monitor triage runs now seed a four-step graph: inspect the failure report, research likely causes and related prior failures, validate or reproduce the failure scope, and propose a fix plus verification plan. Triage runs write inspection, research, validation, fix-proposal, and summary artifacts for downstream issue drafting and autonomous coder handoff.
- **Richer autonomous workflow failure reports**: Terminal automation and workflow failures now produce more specific Bug Monitor submissions with workflow/run/task/stage identifiers, retry exhaustion details, error kind, tool context, artifact refs, files touched, validation errors, expected vs actual output, and suggested next actions.
- **Signal quality metadata and gates**: Bug Monitor incidents, drafts, posts, and TypeScript SDK types now carry confidence, risk level, expected destination, evidence refs, and quality-gate reports. Manual reports can provide the same fields, and noisy or unevidenced intake is persisted as blocked incidents instead of becoming issue drafts.

### Changed

- **GitHub issue drafts are coder-ready when triage supports it**: Bug Monitor issue drafts now include what happened, expected behavior, reproduction steps, environment, logs/artifacts, suspected root cause, recommended fix, likely files, acceptance criteria, verification steps, and hidden Tandem coder handoff metadata when the triage summary is sufficiently confident.
- **Draft-to-proposal and coder-ready gates are enforced server-side**: Issue draft generation now blocks incomplete triage summaries that lack research, validation scope, bounded action, or verification steps. Coder-ready handoff is blocked unless scope, confidence, risk, acceptance criteria, verification, duplicate state, permissions, and tool scopes are acceptable.
- **Bug Monitor cards show the signal lifecycle**: Incidents, drafts, and posts in the control panel now expose signal, draft, triage, proposal, coder-ready, approval, publication, artifact, and memory references when available, with heuristic UI gate checks labelled separately from backend gate reports.
- **Bug Monitor duplicate context is preserved through replay and publish flows**: Duplicate failure-pattern matches are normalized and surfaced in triage artifacts, replay responses, and issue drafts so repeated failures point back to prior evidence instead of generating blank or generic reports.
- **Failure-pattern and regression memory are written from triage**: Completed Bug Monitor triage summaries now feed governed memory with failure patterns and regression signals so recurring failures can dedupe and accelerate future triage.

### Fixed

- **Engine binary entrypoint restored**: Restored the `tandem-engine` binary entrypoint so `cargo build -p tandem-ai --profile fast-release` succeeds again.
- **Automation V2 connector preflight fails fast instead of hanging**: Policy-selected MCP servers now have to connect and register tools before an automation node starts an agent session. If a required connector such as GitHub is enabled but disconnected or syncs zero tools, the node returns `tool_resolution_failed` with MCP diagnostics instead of spending minutes in a doomed session.
- **MCP reconnect after restart is self-healing**: Bug Monitor readiness checks now attempt to reconnect the selected MCP server before reporting it disconnected, and Automation V2 MCP preflight retries selected connector connections briefly before failing closed. This reduces false “GitHub MCP disconnected” states immediately after server restarts.
- **Concrete MCP tool calls self-heal disconnected runtime state**: MCP bridge tools now reconnect enabled remote servers before executing a concrete tool call when the runtime registry marks the server disconnected. This closes the gap where `mcp_list` could show registered GitHub tools but `mcp.githubcopilot.get_me` failed with `MCP server 'githubcopilot' is not connected`.
- **Automation artifact nodes cannot overwrite source files**: Engine sessions now support scoped write policies. Automation V2 artifact-writing nodes are restricted to declared output targets, while explicit code-edit nodes keep repo-edit access. Mutating tool calls outside the session's declared targets are rejected before execution.
- **Automation source-inspection nodes can read without publishing into source targets**: Session write-target detection no longer treats read-only tools such as `read`, `glob`, and `grep` as forbidden writes, so source-inspection nodes can actually inspect the repository under artifact write policy. Intermediate nodes are also blocked from falling back to automation-level output-target publication, preventing a node artifact such as a repository-scope report from being copied into source files like SDK clients or route files.
- **Automation source-scan guardrails now restore corrupted inputs immediately**: File-read/source-scan research nodes now snapshot tracked source-like files before running, fail fast if any are modified, and restore them before artifact reconciliation. This covers the live failure mode where a read-only research node overwrote source files with `PREWRITE_REQUIREMENTS_EXHAUSTED` repair JSON. Repair-exhausted status JSON is also filtered out of session-text artifact recovery so blocked repair state cannot be accepted as a completed `.json` artifact.
- **Automation run cleanup no longer deletes live source output targets**: Run-start cleanup now clears only run-scoped node artifacts, not automation-level publication targets. This prevents workflows whose final outputs are real tracked files, such as `engine/src/main.rs` or SDK/control-panel source files, from deleting those files before source-inspection nodes run.
- **Automation placeholder artifacts fail closed**: Placeholder markdown such as "initial artifact created" / "will be updated in-place" is now treated as incomplete output instead of a valid artifact, so repair loops cannot pass by merely touching the required output path.
- **Connector preflight nodes must call declared MCP tools**: Nodes that declare concrete MCP tools such as `mcp.githubcopilot.get_me` and `mcp.githubcopilot.search_repositories` now fail validation if the exact tools were not executed. A JSON report saying the tools were not attempted can no longer satisfy the node.
- **Connector preflight nodes cannot write artifacts before MCP checks run**: Prompt execution now withholds workspace write tools while a request-scoped allowlist still has unattempted concrete MCP tools. This prevents GitHub connector preflight nodes from writing blocked/status artifacts before calling `mcp.githubcopilot.get_me` and `mcp.githubcopilot.search_repositories`, avoiding long write/repair loops when a connector is cold or disconnected.
- **Connector preflight is now generic required-tool-call execution**: Automation output enforcement can declare `required_tool_calls` with tool names, optional arguments, evidence keys, and required-success flags. Connector-preflight nodes execute declared calls through the normal tool registry and write structured diagnostics before entering the LLM loop, so GitHub, Notion, Gmail, and future MCP checks use the same path instead of GitHub-specific prompt behavior.
- **Repository-scope workflow nodes no longer burn provider time**: Scope/discovery nodes now produce deterministic run artifacts from local workspace path checks instead of entering a long LLM session just to confirm files and glob roots. Missing expected paths are recorded as `missing_paths` evidence rather than blocking the whole workflow.
- **Provider/tool failures no longer leave sessions stuck in progress**: Prompt execution now marks sessions failed and clears cancellation state when provider streaming or tool execution errors bubble out early.
- **Bug Monitor no longer fans out one Automation V2 failure into dozens of mirrored context incidents**: Automation V2 blackboard mirror failures carry workflow/run metadata, and Bug Monitor candidate detection ignores those mirrored context failures so the primary `automation_v2.run.failed` incident remains the canonical report.
- **Automation V2 repair loops now respect node attempt budgets**: Artifact validation records the real node attempt and max-attempt budget, uses that budget to compute repair exhaustion, and blocks hard contract failures such as non-terminal artifacts, missing current-attempt outputs, missing concrete MCP calls, and read-only source mutations instead of resetting repair state back to `repair_attempt: 0`.
- **Automation V2 no longer auto-resumes stale stalled runs by default**: Stale-reaped runs now stay paused for operator inspection unless `TANDEM_ENABLE_STALE_AUTO_RESUME` is explicitly set. This prevents stalled provider/tool sessions from relaunching themselves into another long-running loop after the runtime has already detected missing activity.
- **Completed automation nodes are protected from late stale outcomes**: The executor now ignores late success/failure results for nodes that are already completed or have a passing validated artifact, and exhausted pending nodes report the actual node that hit the attempt cap rather than collapsing into a generic deadlock.
- **Read-only source-scan nodes receive a narrower tool surface**: Broad source-inspection nodes now drop source-mutating tools such as `apply_patch`, `edit`, and shell execution from their allowlist unless they are explicit code-edit nodes, so source archaeology work cannot reach for repo mutation tools just to produce an artifact.

## [0.4.44] - Released 2026-04-27

### Added

- **Memory path import API, SDK support, and control-panel UX**: Added `POST /memory/import` for server-side path imports into Tandem memory, including project/session tier validation, import stats, tenant lifecycle events, and TypeScript/Python SDK helpers (`memory.importPath` / `memory.import_path`). The control panel now exposes path import in both expected places: Files has an `Import to Memory` action for selected folders/files and Memory has an `Import Knowledge` shortcut, with directory/OpenClaw format selection, tier fields, sync-delete control, and import result summaries.
- **Strict KB grounded synthesis toggle**: Added `TANDEM_STRICT_KB_GROUNDED_SYNTHESIS=1` to optionally polish strict-KB answers with an evidence-only synthesis pass. The runtime still validates the result and falls back to deterministic KB rendering when the model introduces unsupported claims.

### Changed

- **Strict KB channel answers now use a fast direct KB path**: Strict-KB text questions call the configured KB MCP `answer_question` tool directly before entering the general LLM tool loop, dramatically reducing Telegram/Discord demo latency while preserving source receipts and strict grounding.
- **KB `answer_question` payloads are first-class evidence**: Tandem now treats KB MCP `suggested_answer` and `evidence[].content` as full grounding evidence, so the runtime no longer discards good KB answers just because a follow-up `get_document` call fails.
- **OpenAI Codex model catalog can refresh from the connected account backend**: The `openai-codex` provider now attempts live model discovery from the Codex account backend when a Codex auth token is available, then falls back to a shared static starter list. The starter list now includes `gpt-5.5` and is shared by the runtime provider and settings catalog so the two surfaces no longer drift.
- **Files is now a primary memory-seeding surface**: The Files route is visible in the main navigation before Memory, reflecting that file/folder selection is the natural place to choose what Tandem should know while Memory remains the runtime knowledge management surface.
- **Memory page separates governed knowledge from runtime messages**: The Memory page now defaults to a Knowledge view and includes Runtime/All filters so raw `user_message`, `assistant_final`, and channel-derived records remain inspectable without making the knowledge surface look like a chat transcript.

### Fixed

- **npm upgrades replace stale native engine binaries**: Fixed issue [#19](https://github.com/frumu-ai/tandem/issues/19) where `@frumu/tandem` postinstall skipped the `tandem-engine` download whenever `bin/native/tandem-engine` already existed, leaving older binaries such as `0.4.19` in place after upgrading the npm package. The installer now checks the existing binary's reported version and downloads/replaces it when it does not match the package version.
- **Strict KB source fetches tolerate MCP display-name normalization**: Full-document retrieval now handles model-facing MCP namespaces such as `aca_kb_mcp_local` and registry names such as `aca-kb-mcp-local`, so changing the MCP name in Settings no longer breaks strict grounding fetches.
- **Strict KB answers no longer leak raw document bodies through `suggested_answer`**: The strict renderer preserves line boundaries, sanitizes nested `Suggested answer:` prefixes, and cuts off leaked sources, markdown headings, and frontmatter before rendering channel replies.
- **Strict KB demo answers stay evidence-only without becoming raw search snippets**: Definition and operational KB questions can now render concise grounded answers with safe source labels, while undefined policies, missing private contact info, and unsupported external actions continue to fail closed.

## [0.4.43] - Released 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- **Hosted Files page now manages workspace repos directly**: Provisioned hosted installs now expose a Workspace explorer rooted at `/workspace/repos`, backed by `TANDEM_CONTROL_PANEL_WORKSPACE_ROOT` in the control panel and `HOSTED_REPOS_ROOT` on the host. The new scoped workspace file APIs list, preview, download, upload files/folders, create folders, and delete workspace entries while rejecting traversal and invalid paths. Managed buckets remain available as a secondary mode, and the Files/KB UI now supports KB collection selection/new collection creation, icon-first controls, collapsible panels, click-to-close previews, and fixed per-page selector styling.
- **Files page no longer breaks against older hosted backends**: The Workspace explorer is now selected only when `/api/capabilities` explicitly reports the workspace file API is available, and a 404 from `/api/workspace/files/list` falls back to managed buckets instead of leaving the page on an unavailable surface.
- **Coding dashboard can prepare project repositories before launch**: Hosted ACA projects can now explicitly sync their managed checkout from the Coding page before a run starts. ACA exposes a repo-sync path that clones missing remotes, fast-forwards clean existing checkouts, refuses dirty pulls, and initializes local non-git folders as local git repositories so local workboards/local files can still use the branch/commit pipeline.
- **Slack channel adapter no longer replays recent messages on engine restart**: `SlackChannel::listen` initialised its `last_ts` cursor to an empty string, so the first `conversations.history` poll after every engine start ran with no `oldest` filter and returned the most recent ten messages. Any user message still in that window — for example a `@Tandem` mention from earlier in the day — was reprocessed and answered again, producing duplicate replies after each restart (Discord and Telegram are unaffected because they use streaming/long-poll with server-acked offsets). The Slack listener now seeds `last_ts` to the listener's startup wallclock formatted as a Slack `seconds.microseconds` timestamp, so only messages posted after the engine starts are picked up.
- **Wizard no longer falls back to a generic plan when the planner LLM hallucinates the wrapper action**: The planner build wrapper expects `{"action":"build", ...}` or `{"action":"clarify", ...}`, but with the longer planner prompt that now teaches phase ids (`discover`/`synthesize`/`validate`/`deliver`) and approval-gate vocabulary, some planner models — observed with `gpt-5.4-mini` — emit step-level labels like `synthesize_analysis_outline` in the wrapper `action` field. `serde_json::from_value::<PlannerBuildPayload>` rejected the response with `unknown variant 'synthesize_analysis_outline', expected 'build' or 'clarify'`, the planner reported `invalid_json`, and the wizard surfaced a "Planner returned a fallback draft" banner with no recoverable plan. `PlannerBuildAction` now has a `#[serde(other)]` `Unknown` variant and `PlannerBuildPayload::resolved_action` infers the canonical action from the payload shape (presence of `plan` ⇒ Build, presence of `clarifier` ⇒ Clarify) so an off-label discriminant no longer trashes a structurally valid plan. The planner prompt also now states explicitly that `action` MUST be the literal string `build` or `clarify` and that step ids and phase ids belong inside `plan.steps`, never in the wrapper. Three new unit tests in `planner_build::tests` cover unknown-action-with-plan, unknown-action-with-clarifier, and canonical pass-through.

## [0.4.42] - Released 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- **Hosted Files page now lists KB collections**: The hosted KB MCP container was dropping privileges from root to the `tandem` user before launching uvicorn, but `/run/secrets/kb_admin_api_key` is mode-`600` root-owned, so the dropped-privilege process could not even `stat` the secret. Every `/admin/*` request died with `PermissionError` inside the auth dependency, which the control-panel proxy surfaced as `configured: false`, leaving the Files page empty on provisioned servers even though it worked locally. The KB launcher now reads the admin key into `KB_ADMIN_API_KEY` while still root, and the settings loader guards the file existence check against `PermissionError`, so the env-var fallback is actually reachable.
- **Hosted task and board endpoints stop returning `name 'logger' is not defined`**: Two ACA modules (`task_sources.py` and `worker.py`) referenced `logger.debug(...)` without ever importing or defining a logger, so every `GET /projects/{slug}/tasks` and `GET /projects/{slug}/board` raised a `NameError` that FastAPI surfaced as a 400 with `{"detail":"name 'logger' is not defined"}`. The control panel could never render project tasks or boards on hosted servers as a result. Both modules now define a module-level logger.
- **Files navigation visible by default for hosted/ACA-mode installs**: `ACA_CORE_NAV_ROUTE_IDS` now includes `files` so provisioned hosted servers (which always bundle the KB MCP) show the Files surface in the sidebar by default instead of hiding it under Advanced / experimental sections that operators have to toggle on manually.

## [0.4.41] - Released 2026-04-26

### Added

- **Unified `ApprovalRequest` type**: New `tandem_types::approvals` module defines `ApprovalRequest`, `ApprovalDecision`, `ApprovalSourceKind`, `ApprovalTenantRef`, `ApprovalActorRef`, `ApprovalDecisionInput`, and `ApprovalListFilter` — one shape every Tandem subsystem (control panel, channels, future surfaces) can consume regardless of which subsystem owns the underlying pending state. Lays the foundation for the agent-owned-workflows-with-runtime-governance pitch (see `docs/internal/approval-gates-and-channel-ux/PLAN.md`).
- **Cross-subsystem approvals aggregator**: New `GET /approvals/pending` endpoint returns a unified list of pending approval requests for the current tenant, drawn from every Tandem subsystem that owns a pending-approval primitive. v1 surfaces `automation_v2` mission runs whose `checkpoint.awaiting_gate` is set; coder and workflow sources will plug in once their pause/resume paths are wired. Supports filtering by `org_id`, `workspace_id`, `source`, and `limit`.
- **Webhook signing module** (`crates/tandem-channels/src/signing.rs`): unified `SigningError` plus per-platform verifiers — Slack HMAC-SHA256 with 5-minute replay protection (`verify_slack_signature`), Telegram per-webhook secret-token constant-time compare (`verify_telegram_secret_token`), and a Discord Ed25519 stub (`verify_discord_signature`) that returns `SecretNotConfigured` until `ed25519-dalek` lands in W4. 22 unit tests cover valid signatures, missing/malformed headers, replay window, body tampering, and secret mismatches.
- **`Channel::send_card(InteractiveCard)` trait extension** (`crates/tandem-channels/src/traits.rs`): one normalized `InteractiveCard` shape (title, body markdown, fields, buttons with primary/secondary/destructive styles, optional reason prompt, optional thread key, opaque correlation) every channel adapter renders to its native interactive primitive. Default impl returns `InteractiveCardError::NotImplemented` so the type system tells callers which adapters have wired rich rendering. Companion `supports_interactive_cards()` lets the future fan-out task pick rich vs text fallback without a wasted API call.
- **Slack Block Kit renderer** (`crates/tandem-channels/src/slack_blocks.rs`): pure functions converting `InteractiveCard` to Block Kit JSON. `render_card_blocks` produces the header / context / body / fields / divider / actions layout. `build_post_message_payload` wraps for `chat.postMessage` (with optional `thread_ts`), `build_chat_update_payload_for_decision` produces the post-decision in-place edit that swaps buttons for a "Decided by …" context line, `build_rework_modal_payload` renders the rework reason modal. 18 golden tests assert exact Block Kit output, button styling, confirm dialogs, button-value round-trip with correlation, and modal shape.
- **`POST /channels/slack/interactions` endpoint** (`crates/tandem-server/src/http/slack_interactions.rs`): receives Slack interaction callbacks (button clicks on Block Kit cards). HMAC-verifies every request, ack within 3 seconds, bounded LRU dedup ring on `(action_ts, action_id)` to absorb Slack's retry-on-missed-ack, parses the URL-encoded `payload` field, dispatches `approve` / `cancel` directly to `automations_v2_run_gate_decide`. New `SlackConfigFile.signing_secret` field carries the app signing secret (config-file or keystore). Rework decisions parse correctly; the modal round-trip lands in W4 with the rest of the Discord/Telegram modals.
- **Slack interaction race UX**: `automations_v2_run_gate_decide` now returns the winner's identity in its 409 conflict body (`winningDecision { node_id, decision, reason, decided_at_ms }` plus `currentStatus`). When two surfaces try to decide the same gate concurrently, the loser's UI can render "already decided by …" instead of a raw error. Integration test confirms shape.
- **Tool approval classifier** (`crates/tandem-tools/src/approval_classifier.rs`): table-driven classifier mapping tool / capability / MCP-tool IDs to `RequiresApproval | NoApproval | UserConfigurable`. Built-in tables cover read-only built-ins (`read`, `glob`, `grep`, `websearch`, `kb_search`) and destructive built-ins (`rm`, `delete`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `send_email`). Prefix tables cover CRM (`mcp.hubspot.*`, `mcp.salesforce.*`), payments (`mcp.stripe.*`), outbound email (`mcp.gmail.send`, `mcp.sendgrid.*`), public posts (`mcp.linkedin.*`, `mcp.twitter.*`), calendar, trackers (`mcp.linear.*`, `mcp.jira.*`), Notion writes, Slack/Discord/Telegram outbound, GitHub mutating verbs, and Tandem coder merge/publish. Suffix heuristics catch unknown servers' `.send`, `.publish`, `.create`, `.update`, `.delete`, `.merge`, `.pay`, `.charge`, `.refund` verbs. `classify_node_allowlist` aggregates a node's allowlist with fail-closed semantics; `allowlist_is_wildcard` flags `*`/`mcp.*`. 19 unit tests.
- **Default-on approval-gate compiler injection**: new `inject_default_approval_gates` pass in `crates/tandem-plan-compiler/src/mission_runtime.rs` runs after node sort. For every projected workstream node, it reads the effective tool allowlist (via `metadata.builder.tool_allowlist_override` or the bound agent's `tool_allowlist`), classifies the aggregate, and attaches a `default_injected_gate` when the node touches an external mutation. Idempotent (skips nodes with explicit gates), scope-override-aware (honors `metadata.approval.skip_approval = true`), and skips Approval/Review stages whose gates are blueprint-owned. 7 new golden tests cover CRM-write injection, outbound-email injection, pure-read no-injection, wildcard injection, unknown-tool fail-closed, scope-override skip, and explicit-blueprint-gate preservation.
- **Planner prompt: approval-gate policy** (`crates/tandem-plan-compiler/src/planner_prompts.rs`): new "Approval gates:" section in `workflow_plan_common_sections()` tells the planner agent the runtime auto-wraps high-stakes steps in gates, that it should not add gates itself but describe the workflow as if they're present, that it should batch related external actions to minimize approval count, and that it should declare `stage_kind=Approval` when the gate is the point of the step.
- **`#/approvals` Approvals Inbox page** (`packages/tandem-control-panel/src/pages/ApprovalsInboxPage.tsx`): operator-shaped page that polls `GET /approvals/pending` every 5s and renders each pending request as a card with workflow name, source label, action preview, identifiers, requested-at relative time, and Approve / Rework / Cancel buttons. Rework opens an inline reason form. Race-aware: a 409 from gate-decide renders as a toast saying "Already decided by another operator" and refreshes the queue. Wired into the navigation as a top-level route.
- **Discord Ed25519 signature verification** (`crates/tandem-channels/src/signing.rs`): the W2 `verify_discord_signature` stub is now a real implementation using `ed25519-dalek`. Decodes the application public key (32-byte hex), reconstructs the signed payload as `{timestamp}{body}`, and `verify_strict`s the Ed25519 signature. Rejects on missing/malformed headers, invalid public-key hex, wrong signature, wrong body, wrong timestamp, and forged-key signatures. 9 new tests cover all paths.
- **Discord rich-UX renderer** (`crates/tandem-channels/src/discord_blocks.rs`): pure functions converting `InteractiveCard` to Discord embed + action-row JSON. `build_create_message_payload` (one embed + chunked action rows + `allowed_mentions: parse=[]` so approval cards never @-ping); `build_edit_message_payload_for_decision` (clears components, switches embed color amber→emerald/indigo/red per decision, replaces description with "Decided by …" footer); `build_rework_modal_data` + `wrap_as_modal_response` (Discord modal with text input); `build_deferred_update_response` (type-6 ack); `build_update_message_response` (type-7 inline edit). `parse_custom_id` round-trips the `tdm:{action}:{run_id}:{node_id}` correlation. 19 golden tests assert exact JSON shapes, button styles, modal payload, color transitions, and 5-button row chunking.
- **`POST /channels/discord/interactions` endpoint** (`crates/tandem-server/src/http/discord_interactions.rs`): receives every Discord interaction (PING, button click, modal submit, slash command). Verifies Ed25519 on every request and rejects with 401 on failure (Discord disables endpoints that fail validation). PING → PONG. MESSAGE_COMPONENT (type 3) parses `data.custom_id`, dispatches `approve`/`cancel` directly to `automations_v2_run_gate_decide`, opens a modal (type-9 response) on Rework. MODAL_SUBMIT (type 5) extracts the user's reason from the text-input value and dispatches with `reason`. APPLICATION_COMMAND returns a "slash commands land in W5" placeholder so Discord stays valid. Bounded LRU dedup on `interaction_id` absorbs Discord retries. Race UX (W2.6) maps non-200 gate-decide failures to a UPDATE_MESSAGE response so Discord stays happy and the user sees the conflict. New `DiscordConfigFile.public_key` field. 3 unit tests on dedup + custom_id format.
- **Telegram inline-keyboard renderer** (`crates/tandem-channels/src/telegram_keyboards.rs`): pure functions converting `InteractiveCard` to Telegram Bot API JSON. `build_send_message_payload` (MarkdownV2 text + inline keyboard chunked at 3 buttons per row); `build_edit_message_text_for_decision` (replaces text with "Decided by …" summary and clears keyboard); `build_clear_keyboard_payload` (optimistic hide-buttons before round-trip); `build_force_reply_for_rework` (Telegram's substitute for a modal — `force_reply: true` with selective targeting). Emoji prefixes (`✓`/`✗`/none) signal button intent visually. `build_callback_data` packs the correlation under Telegram's 64-byte cap with truncation marker; `parse_callback_data` exposes the truncation flag. Full MarkdownV2 escaping via `escape_markdown_v2`. 16 golden tests cover keyboard layout, callback_data round-trip and truncation, MarkdownV2 escaping, force-reply payload, and label truncation.
- **`POST /channels/telegram/interactions` endpoint** (`crates/tandem-server/src/http/telegram_interactions.rs`): receives Telegram callback_query updates. Verifies `x-telegram-bot-api-secret-token` against configured `webhook_secret_token` on every request. Bounded dedup on `update_id`. Parses callback_data, dispatches `approve`/`cancel` directly to `automations_v2_run_gate_decide`. `rework` taps log + ack — the force-reply capture state machine ships in W5 (shares plumbing with `channel_automation_drafts`). Truncated callback_data fails closed pending the W5 short-lived cache. Race UX maps non-200 to 200 + log so Telegram doesn't double-fire. New `TelegramConfigFile.webhook_secret_token` field. 3 unit tests on dedup + callback_data round-trip.
- **Approval notification fan-out task** (`crates/tandem-server/src/app/approval_outbound.rs`): polling outbox that watches `/approvals/pending` and dispatches new requests to a `Vec<Arc<dyn ApprovalNotifier>>`. **Deliberate departure from the existing event-bus pattern** — the broadcast bus drops on `Lagged(_)` and a missed approval notification means a stuck run; polling the aggregator (an idempotent read of durable state) avoids that failure mode. In-memory `DedupRing` (FIFO eviction at 8192 cap) prevents re-dispatch; `prune_to` evicts decided requests so any (improbable) resurfacing is safe. `ApprovalNotifier` trait + `NotifierError::Transient`/`Permanent` distinction lets surfaces decide their own retry/suppression strategy. `run_polling_loop` exposes a cooperative `Arc<AtomicBool>` cancel for deterministic shutdown. 9 unit tests cover first-sweep dispatch, dedup, newly-added-mid-run, decided-then-resurfaced, failing-notifier isolation, dedup eviction, and prune semantics.
- **Slash commands `/pending` and `/rework`** (`crates/tandem-channels/src/dispatcher_parts/part01.rs` + `part03.rs`): `/pending` GETs `/approvals/pending` and renders a chat-friendly summary (numbered list with workflow name, run_id, action_kind, footer reminding users to click card buttons or `/rework`). `/rework <run_id> <feedback>` POSTs `/automations/v2/runs/{run_id}/gate` with the feedback as `reason`; surfaces 409 race conflicts as friendly "already decided by another operator" toasts via the W2.6 race body. Both registered in `BUILTIN_CHANNEL_COMMANDS` with the `approval` audience and `enabled_for_public_demo: false` so registry-driven `/help` shows them in operator/trusted-team channels and disables them in PublicDemo. Reuses the existing `relay_tool_decision`-shaped HTTP helper. 5 unit tests on parser entries, missing-feedback rejection, registry presence, and PublicDemo disable.
- **Channel authority chain resolver** (`crates/tandem-server/src/app/state/principals/channel_identity.rs`): `resolve_channel_user(effective_config, kind, surface_user_id) -> ChannelIdentityResolution` returns one of `Resolved(RequestPrincipal)`, `ChannelNotConfigured(kind)`, or `Denied { kind, user_id }`. The principal carries `actor_id = "channel:{kind}:{user_id}"` and `source = "channel:{kind}"` so distinct channel surfaces never alias the same user ID. Allowlist semantics: empty `allowed_users` is **deny-all** (channels must explicitly opt users in); `*` is wildcard; case-insensitive matching; `@`-prefixed Telegram-style entries match unprefixed user IDs. Callers MUST treat `Denied` and `ChannelNotConfigured` as hard rejects — never silently approve as anonymous, because the audit trail would carry no actor for an external mutation. 12 unit tests cover wildcard, deny-by-default, case insensitivity, `@`-prefix matching, missing config, missing user, and per-kind actor-id distinguishing.
- **Concurrent-race regression test** (`crates/tandem-server/src/http/tests/approvals_aggregator.rs::gate_decide_concurrent_race_yields_exactly_one_winner`): fires two `POST /automations/v2/runs/{run_id}/gate` requests in parallel via `tokio::spawn` against the same run with a real pending gate. Asserts exactly one 200 + one 409, that the loser's body carries `winningDecision { node_id, decision, reason, decided_at_ms }` (W2.6), and that `gate_history.len() == 1` post-race. Improves on W2.6's single-threaded simulated-state test by exercising the actual per-run mutation lock under concurrent contention.
- **Chat-native automation drafts**: Discord, Telegram, Slack, and direct chat requests can now start bounded automation drafts in the same channel context without routing through the experimental workflow planner.
- **Channel automation draft API**: Added `/automations/channel-drafts` endpoints to start or continue a draft, answer follow-up questions, confirm creation, cancel drafts, and inspect pending drafts for diagnostics.
- **Pending channel interactions**: Channel dispatch now tracks pending draft questions by platform, scope, thread/session, and sender so the next eligible reply from the same user answers the draft while other users, scopes, and slash commands are ignored.
- **Control-panel chat guidance**: Channel settings now explain next-reply capture, confirmation, cancellation, and same-channel bounds for chat-created automations.
- **Default engine API token auth**: `tandem-engine serve` now loads or creates a shared API token by default, so direct engine starts are authenticated without requiring users to manually pass `--api-token`.
- **Explicit unsafe tokenless mode**: Advanced local-only testing can disable engine API auth with `--unsafe-no-api-token` or `TANDEM_UNSAFE_NO_API_TOKEN=1`.
- **Workflow-planning visibility and provenance**: Chat-seeded workflow planning now persists explicit `workflow_planning` state with draft and session IDs, source channel/platform, requesting actor, allowed and blocked tools, known and missing requirements, and validation state.
- **Clarification-first drafting**: Missing workflow details now trigger focused follow-up questions about triggers, inputs, outputs, publish behavior, required tools, approval, and memory/files instead of generating a vague draft.
- **Control-panel handoff and audit events**: Workflow drafts now surface a review banner in the control panel, emit structured planning lifecycle events, and include a short preview plus review link in external replies.
- **Internal demo runbook**: Added `docs/internal/CHAT_WORKFLOW_PLANNER_DEMO.md` for end-to-end manual testing.
- **KB-first channel grounding**: MCP servers can now be marked as `purpose: "knowledgebase"` / `grounding_required: true`, and channel sessions that explicitly enable those KB MCP tools force a KB discovery/search turn before answering factual questions from chat.
- **Strict KB-grounded channel answers**: Channel configs now accept `strict_kb_grounding`, which rewrites channel replies from retrieved KB excerpts only, emits `I do not see that in the connected knowledgebase.` when retrieval does not support the answer, and adds compact source receipts when KB search results expose file paths.
- **Full-document strict KB evidence**: Strict KB mode now follows KB search hits with `get_document` retrieval when source identifiers are available, so channel answers are grounded in full source documents instead of truncated snippets.

### Changed

- **Engine auth is secure by default**: Tokenless engine serving is now an explicit unsafe opt-out instead of the default fallback when no `TANDEM_API_TOKEN` is provided.
- **Capability governance stays explicit**: Blocked tools, missing requirements, and approval requests now flow through the existing planner and session structures instead of being widened silently.
- **Ordinary automation requests stay chat-native**: Setup understanding and channel dispatch route `automation_create` intents into the new draft flow, while the workflow planner remains gated for explicit planner requests.
- **Workflow planner replies stay in chat**: Channel workflow-planning responses now surface planner questions, draft summaries, validation state, and blocked capabilities in the chat thread, with the control-panel link kept for review/apply.
- **External channels stay draft-first**: Telegram, Discord, and Slack continue to return compact review-oriented responses and cannot directly activate workflows.
- **Planner provenance**: Control-panel initiated requests remain human-owned, and agent-authored drafts retain their source provenance through reloads.
- **Safe KB source receipts**: Strict KB channel replies now use display-safe document labels such as `Company Overview` or `Sponsor FAQ` instead of exposing local filesystem paths, storage keys, or internal `doc_id` values.

### Fixed

- **Cross-channel draft safety**: Pending draft answers now expire, require the same sender and chat scope, and can be cancelled with `cancel`, `stop`, or `never mind`.
- **Docs MCP is not authoring permission**: Tandem Docs MCP availability no longer implies workflow-planning permission.
- **Workflow planning fallthrough**: Bare workflow requests no longer fall through to generic setup when the channel has workflow planning enabled.
- **Connector-heavy workflow prompts**: Scheduled workflow prompts that mention MCPs or destinations such as Notion now route to workflow planning instead of being mistaken for integration setup.
- **Planner thread hijacking**: Linked workflow planner sessions no longer capture ordinary informational chat like "what is ..." or "what do I do?", and planner-model setup pauses now explain the admin action instead of asking for an impossible answer.
- **KB endpoint fail-closed gating**: Control-panel KB upload/browse queries now wait for `/api/knowledgebase/config` to confirm the KB admin service is reachable, avoiding noisy `/collections` and `/documents` 502s when the admin backend is configured but down.
- **KB nested document deletes**: Control-panel KB admin proxy requests now preserve encoded slashes in document slugs, so documents stored under nested paths can be deleted instead of returning 404.
- **Strict KB snippet hallucinations**: Strict KB answers now fail closed when a likely document cannot be fetched, preserve exact document facts, and avoid inventing unsupported policies, private-contact details, or external platform instructions from partial search excerpts.
- **Strict KB external-action leakage**: Strict KB answers to external action questions now stay extractive and policy-only, preventing generic platform UI steps such as Discord ban instructions from leaking into channel replies.
- **Strict KB provider-error repair**: Provider stream decode failures during strict KB turns now get a strict grounding repair pass and a non-streaming synthesis retry before any channel-safe fallback is returned.
- **Strict KB final-answer enforcement**: Strict KB channel replies now render final answers from retrieved evidence sentences instead of model-authored helpful prose, closing the escape hatch for invented payout processes, staff-directory advice, escalation channels, and platform how-to steps.
- **Strict KB wildcard channel grounding**: Channels with default wildcard tool access now still force enabled knowledgebase MCPs into the strict KB search policy, so Telegram/Discord KB bots do not bypass grounding unless the KB MCP is explicitly disabled.
- **Strict KB MCP-context routing**: Channel messages with an explicitly selected MCP context now treat factual questions as strict KB turns even when the global channel strict-KB toggle is off, preventing Telegram DMs from falling back to generic chat after a KB bot has been configured.

## [0.4.40] - Released 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Channel workflow planning handoff**: Chat-driven workflow requests can now create or resume governed planner sessions, persist a review draft, and open the workflow planner with source-channel metadata plus a control-panel review link.
- **Planner review metadata**: Workflow planner sessions and drafts now store source platform/channel, linked session IDs, docs-MCP usage, required and blocked capabilities, validation state, approval state, and preview payloads so review data survives reloads.

### Changed

- **Workflow-planner gate**: The new `tandem.workflow_planner` pseudo-tool now controls whether chat can seed workflow drafts, and public-demo channels strip the gate out of saved tool preferences.
- **Planner intent routing**: Setup understanding now scores workflow-planning requests ahead of generic integration setup, which sends prompts like "draft a workflow plan" straight into planner mode.
- **Planner capability governance**: Capability gaps discovered during planning now feed the existing `mcp_request_capability` approval path instead of being ignored.

### Fixed

- **External channel safety**: Telegram, Discord, and Slack workflow-intent replies stay summary-only and no longer activate workflows directly from chat.
- **Planner allowlist integrity**: The workflow-planner gate is excluded from the real tool allowlist so it cannot widen channel MCP access or slip through sanitization.

## [0.4.39] - Released 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Request-scoped prewrite repair policy**: Engine-facing prewrite requirements now carry node-derived repair budget and repair-exhaustion behavior so governed automation steps can enforce fail-closed repair semantics without relying only on a global environment toggle.
- **Built-in Tandem Docs MCP bootstrap**: Control panels now inherit a preinstalled `tandem-mcp` server pointed at `https://tandem.ac/mcp`, so Tandem documentation tools are available on first load without a manual MCP add step.

### Changed

- **Governed workflow repair enforcement**: Strict-quality workflow nodes now inherit their repair behavior from `output_contract.enforcement`, allowing governed runs to fail closed after repair exhaustion while non-strict nodes keep the existing waive-and-write fallback.
- **Repair-loop tool targeting**: Concrete-read repair guidance now prefers `read` once workspace inspection is already satisfied, reducing low-signal `glob` loops during governed artifact recovery.
- **Automation/server repair-state alignment**: Automation validation and repair-state inference now use the same node repair budget and exhaustion semantics as the engine so downstream orchestration sees a consistent blocked state.
- **Control-panel MCP defaults**: The engine now bootstraps Tandem Docs MCP as a built-in remote server and publishes it through the normal MCP registry path, so it appears in Settings alongside other servers and remains subject to the existing enable/disable and per-tool allowlist controls.

### Fixed

- **False forward progress after exhausted governed repairs**: Strict-quality research and artifact-writing nodes now emit a structured blocked completion with `repair_budget_exhausted` instead of waiving unmet evidence requirements and writing best-effort placeholder outputs.
- **Governed retry-budget drift**: Node-level `repair_budget` now propagates from automation enforcement into engine execution, eliminating mismatches between validator repair counting and runtime repair retries.
- **Hosted Codex `auth.json` import readback**: Tandem now tolerates string-valued Codex CLI `last_refresh` metadata when parsing uploaded OAuth sessions, which fixes hosted control-panel imports that immediately failed with “The imported Codex auth.json could not be read back on this machine.”

## [0.4.38] - Released 2026-04-22

### Added

- **BUSL governance-engine split**: Recursive governance policy now lives in the new `tandem-governance-engine` BUSL crate, while `tandem-server` keeps the same public routes and tool names and falls back to explicit premium-feature errors when premium governance is disabled.
- **Workflow planner latency advisory**: The automation create wizard now warns when a connector-heavy or unusually detailed workflow prompt may take a few minutes to plan, which gives operators clearer expectations before the planner call starts.
- **Automation wizard MCP continuity**: The create wizard now preserves its draft across MCP setup round-trips, shows a return path from the MCP page, and exposes inline connect/authenticate actions for disconnected servers so operators can recover connector-backed plans without re-entering the workflow request.
- **Async workflow planner session operations**: Workflow planner sessions now persist background start/message operations plus their final response or failure payload, and the client can poll that state instead of relying on one long-lived planner HTTP request surviving the whole run.
- **AI Composer agent test mode**: The automation composer now exposes a testing switch for synthetic agent creation flows that sends `x-tandem-agent-test-mode`, `x-tandem-request-source: agent`, and `x-tandem-agent-id` when enabled, allowing operators to validate `AUTOMATION_V2_AGENT_*` and escalation checks before using an external agent client.
- **Agent-classification documentation updates**: Control panel and engine-auth docs now document request-source precedence, agent lineage handling, and the dedicated test path for enforcing agent governance in composer.

### Changed

- **LLM guide availability notes**: Self-Operator, MCP capability-request, and governance docs now explain the premium governance boundary while keeping the same operational flow and canonical tool names.
- **Premium lifecycle governance extraction**: Health-drift, expiration, retirement, and dependency-revocation policy evaluation now flows through the BUSL governance engine, while the open server only gathers run evidence, persists the resulting state transitions, and no-ops the internal health checker in OSS builds.
- **Long-running workflow planner budgets**: Workflow-plan preview calls now wait longer before timing out, with a higher server-side clamp and a larger control-panel client timeout for connector-heavy planning sessions.
- **Planner prompt compaction**: The control panel now compresses the default knowledge subject it sends with workflow-planner requests instead of echoing the full workflow prompt back into operator preferences, reducing redundant planner payload size on long prompts.
- **Planner chat transport path**: Control-panel workflow planning now creates or reuses planner sessions and polls short-lived async operations under the hood, so wizard and planner chat flows no longer depend on a single proxy-sensitive `/workflow-plans/chat/*` request.

### Fixed

- **Workflow planner fallback visibility**: The automation review step now treats planner clarification and fallback drafts as blocked states, hides the generic scaffold that used to appear after failed planning runs, and prevents creating an automation from that placeholder output.
- **Planner timeout messaging**: Gateway `524` responses from workflow-plan requests now surface as explicit engine timeout errors instead of raw HTTP failure text, making slow planner runs easier to diagnose.
- **Planner stream decode recovery**: Workflow planning now retries once with a non-streamed provider completion when the streamed planner response dies with decode/body corruption errors, which prevents `error decoding response body` from dropping the whole workflow build when the provider can still return a valid final answer.
- **Codex streamed completion recovery**: OpenAI Codex planner fallbacks now recover with a streamed `/responses` retry when the provider insists that `stream` must stay enabled, instead of failing the whole planner fallback with a `400`.
- **Planner clarification timeout parity**: Follow-up clarification/revision requests now inherit the same longer timeout budget as initial planner builds, avoiding the old 120-second cliff after the first planner question.
- **Refresh auth bootstrap noise**: Hard-refreshing the control panel after a rebuild no longer fires a spurious `/api/auth/me 401` before the remembered token restores the session.
- **Wizard step navigation scroll**: Advancing between automation wizard steps now scrolls the active container back to the top so each new screen opens at the correct starting position.
- **Control-panel automation provenance**: Control-panel engine proxy requests now mark themselves as `control_panel`, strip leaked browser agent lineage headers, and the engine governance path now treats that request source as human-owned so create and run-now automation requests no longer fail with `AUTOMATION_V2_AGENT_ID_REQUIRED`.

## [0.4.37] - Released 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Self-Operator governance foundation**: Automation v2 now persists provenance, lineage depth, grants, approval requests, and soft-delete retention, with server-side creation and mutation enforcement.
- **Tenant agent-creation controls**: Per-agent creation pauses, rolling daily quotas, and active agent-authored automation caps are now enforced at the engine route layer.
- **Declared-capability recursion gate**: Agent-authored automations now carry declared capability flags, and server-side checks block unapproved `creates_agents` or `modifies_grants` escalation at create and patch time.
- **Agent spend accounting and caps**: Automation v2 usage now rolls up per-agent daily, weekly, monthly, and lifetime spend summaries, warns at a configurable threshold, hard-stops agents at the weekly cap, and creates quota-override approval requests when spend guardrails trip.
- **Lifecycle review and retirement**: Agent-authored automations now trigger creation and run-based review thresholds, expire on a configurable timer, pause on expiration, expose retire/extend routes, and feed a periodic health-check drift pass into the shared approval inbox.
- **Revocation-driven pause/review**: Revoking a modify grant or narrowing an automation agent's MCP policy now pauses the automation, records a dependency-revocation review, and routes the operator through the shared approval queue before agent mutation can continue.
- **MCP catalog overlay and capability requests**: `/mcp/catalog` now returns a connection-status overlay on top of the embedded catalog, and agents can file `mcp_request_capability` approval requests through the shared governance queue when they discover a gap.
- **Custom control-panel modals**: Native browser alerts, confirms, and prompts have been replaced with Tandem-styled modal dialogs across Files, Task Planning, and KB document actions so naming and destructive flows stay inside the app shell.
- **Knowledgebase document actions**: The KB viewer now supports inline preview expansion, edit-in-place, and delete for uploaded documents, with icon-first controls and a cleaner accordion-style layout.
- **Channel exact MCP tool scopes**: Channel tool preferences now support exact MCP tool allowlists in addition to server-level MCP enables, which lets public or constrained channels grant just the tools they need.

### Changed

- **Sidebar ordering**: The control-panel sidebar now uses an explicit route order so `Settings` stays pinned to the bottom and `Files` remains grouped with the core navigation.
- **KB viewer flow**: The knowledgebase panel now behaves like a document browser rather than a static upload log, with collapsed previews, explicit expansion, and in-place document editing.

### Fixed

- **KB document deletion UX**: KB document deletion now uses the shared modal flow and the existing admin DELETE route instead of a native browser confirm dialog.
- **Channel MCP allowlist propagation**: Exact MCP tool selections now survive channel sanitization and merge behavior so scoped channels can retain tool-level MCP permissions without being widened back to server-wide exposure.

## [0.4.36] - Released 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Per-server MCP tool allowlists**: Connected MCP servers now expose their discovered tools as individual allowlist entries, so operators can disable specific MCP tools without disconnecting the whole server.
- **Workflow and Studio MCP tool narrowing**: Automation workflow editing and Studio agent editing now support exact MCP tool selection in addition to server-level MCP selection, enabling public knowledge bots and other constrained agents to inherit only the MCP tools they should see.

### Fixed

- **Exact MCP policy enforcement**: MCP inventory, `mcp_list`, and automation session scoping now honor exact MCP tool allowlists instead of broadening exact tool selections back into `mcp.<server>.*` server-wide exposure.
- **Server policy propagation into the runtime**: MCP server edits now persist the tool allowlist, resync registered tools immediately, and remove hidden MCP tools from the exposed registry instead of continuing to offer stale tool schemas after policy changes.

## [0.4.35] - Released 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Hosted Codex auth import**: Tandem-hosted managed servers can now import a Codex `auth.json` from Settings, and the VM stores it under the persistent Codex home so the session survives restarts.
- **Hosted Codex sign-in recovery**: Pending Codex browser sign-ins now survive a control-panel refresh in the current browser session, so operators can return to Settings without losing the in-progress handoff.
- **Provider auth-source visibility**: The control panel now carries the default provider's auth source and management mode through provider status, so hosted Codex setups can surface that they are running from an imported `auth.json` or a mirrored local Codex session.

### Fixed

- **Providers-first onboarding**: The provider setup gate now routes to Providers and expands the provider catalog on first view instead of landing on the Install section.
- **Hosted settings visibility**: Web Search and Scheduler settings are now available on Tandem-hosted managed servers, so provisioned installs can configure Brave/Exa keys and scheduler defaults without a local engine URL.
- **Hosted Codex callback regression coverage**: The server now has a real authorize-route regression test proving hosted-managed Codex OAuth uses the public hosted callback URL instead of falling back to `localhost:1455`.
- **MCP OAuth hosted handoff UX**: OAuth-backed MCP packs such as Notion now clearly steer operators into browser sign-in, keep pending auth visible in both MCP surfaces, and recheck pending sessions automatically without requiring a manual refresh loop.
- **MCP OAuth protocol bootstrap**: Remote MCP OAuth servers such as Notion can now start authorization from a `401` + `WWW-Authenticate` challenge, complete PKCE client registration and callback handling server-side, store the returned bearer token, and reconnect automatically after browser sign-in.
- **MCP callback origin correction**: MCP OAuth callbacks now use the forwarded control-panel/browser origin instead of falling back to the raw engine bind address, which fixes local-IP installs that were redirecting to `127.0.0.1:39731` and tripping the engine API-token gate.

## [0.4.33] - Released 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **Hosted install profile propagation**: The live control panel startup path now returns hosted-managed metadata from `/api/install/profile` and `/api/capabilities`, so provisioned hosted servers are recognized as managed installs and the Codex Account button is enabled without manual config edits.
- **Hosted Codex OAuth routing**: Hosted-managed servers continue to use the hosted public control-plane URL for OAuth callbacks instead of falling back to the localhost-only flow.

## [0.4.32] - Released 2026-04-19

### Added

- **Hosted-safe Codex OAuth**: Tandem-hosted control panels can now connect Codex on provisioned servers through the hosted OAuth flow instead of being blocked behind the local-engine-only browser path.
- **Hosted control-panel file explorer**: The Files route now opens a managed three-pane explorer for uploads, artifacts, and exports, with folder navigation, inline previews, downloads, and deep links from chat and automation artifacts.

### Changed

- **Hosted provider UX**: The Codex account connect/reconnect controls in Settings now stay enabled on Tandem-hosted managed servers, with copy updated to explain that hosted mode uses the hosted OAuth path.
- **Directory-aware file APIs**: `/api/files/list`, `/api/files/upload`, `/api/files/read`, and `/api/files/download` now work with visible managed paths and tree-aware metadata instead of a flat file list.

### Fixed

- **Codex callback routing for hosted servers**: Codex OAuth now uses the hosted public callback route when Tandem is running in hosted-managed mode, so provisioned servers can complete the authorization flow without relying on a localhost callback.
- **Hosted fallback behavior**: Hosted control panels no longer get stuck on generic provider fallback just because Codex account sign-in was gated to local-engine-only mode.
- **Managed file path handling**: File explorer handoffs and download/read routes now normalize visible bucket paths, reject traversal, and degrade gracefully for non-previewable files.

## [0.4.31] - Released 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Workflow output path previewing**: The Studio workflow editor now shows draft, saved, and next-run-resolved output paths so operators can see exactly how timestamped filenames will materialize before saving or running.
- **Workflow output token guidance**: Studio now documents the supported runtime filename tokens directly in workflow settings and stage editing, reducing guesswork when authoring timestamped reports and artifacts.
- **Declared output artifacts in node prompts**: Automation prompts now include a dedicated "Declared Output Artifacts (CREATE — do not READ)" section when a node has `metadata.artifacts`, `builder.output_files`, or `builder.must_write_files`. Agents are told explicitly these paths are outputs to create, ENOENT on them is expected, and returning a "missing source file" blocker is not acceptable — fixing a class of stalled runs where agents misread their own outputs as prerequisite inputs.
- **Declared-output repair corrective**: The repair brief now detects when a prior attempt claimed a declared output was a missing source file and prepends a targeted corrective instruction on the next attempt, so the retry doesn't repeat the misinterpretation.
- **Token usage capture on streaming chat completions**: OpenAI-compatible chat-completions streaming now requests `stream_options.include_usage`, restoring real per-call prompt/completion/total token counts (and downstream cost attribution) that were previously silently zero.
- **Dashboard token usage panel**: The control panel dashboard now shows token usage and estimated cost bucketed by day/week/month, not just aggregate totals.
- **Run debugger token/cost display**: The run debugger now surfaces prompt, completion, total tokens, and estimated USD cost per run so operators can see real spend without leaving the UI.
- **Daily automation run archiver**: A background task now moves terminal (`completed`/`failed`/`blocked`/`cancelled`) automation runs older than `TANDEM_AUTOMATION_V2_RUNS_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 7) out of the hot `automation_v2_runs.json` and into `automation_v2_runs_archive.json`. Runs at startup and every 24 hours. Archive file is written atomically via temp-file + rename.
- **Executor supervisor self-healing**: The automation v2 executor now wraps its main loop in `catch_unwind` and respawns on panic, so a single state panic can no longer strand queued runs forever with no polling.

### Changed

- **Workflow output path canonicalization**: Legacy filename placeholders such as `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`, `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`, and `{{date}}` are now normalized to Tandem-native runtime tokens on automation save/load instead of being stored literally.
- **Workflow planner timeout defaults**: Workflow generation now gives Codex-backed planning more time before aborting, making long-form workflow drafting and mission-plan generation less brittle.
- **Provider picker decluttering**: Non-settings provider/model selectors now show only configured or connected providers, and internal channel/MCP config providers are filtered out so the global catalog stays available where it matters without cluttering everyday pickers.
- **Control panel number/currency formatters hoisted**: `formatCompactNumber` and `formatUsd` moved from `DashboardPage.tsx` into shared `src/lib/format.ts` so run debugger, dashboard, and other pages render token/cost values identically.

### Fixed

- **Workflow planner failure visibility**: The workflow wizard now surfaces planning failures instead of silently dismissing the progress window when a planner attempt times out or fails.
- **Workflow output-contract repair**: Fallback-generated workflow steps now infer the correct output contract across markdown, text, JSON, and code/config file types instead of collapsing final deliverables into junky `structured_json` outputs.
- **Saved automation auto-heal**: Already-persisted malformed workflows now repair their output contracts, upstream input refs, and output path templates automatically on load/save instead of requiring manual JSON surgery.
- **Timestamped workflow filenames**: Automation prompts, validators, and artifact reconciliation now resolve runtime filename placeholders consistently, so workflows that ask for timestamped outputs stop writing to literal `YYYY-MM-DD...` paths or failing validation against unresolved targets.
- **Studio output-path authoring UX**: Workflow authors now get inline warnings when an output path still contains ambiguous placeholder text, making bad timestamp/path patterns much easier to catch before a run.
- **Email-delivery gate false positives**: The engine-loop email gate that overwrites the agent's completion text only fires when email-action tools were actually offered during at least one iteration, not just from substring-matching "send" + "email" in the rendered prompt. Previously, unrelated nodes (e.g. blog authors that saw gmail tool names in an MCP catalog listing) had their legitimate output clobbered with "I could not verify that an email was sent".
- **Concurrent-batch outcome loss in the executor**: When one outcome in a `join_all` batch produced a terminal `Err`, the remaining sibling outcomes in the same batch were silently dropped. The loop now `continue`s instead of `break`ing, preserving successful siblings.
- **Spurious run-level failure from batch-mates**: A node that succeeded now rescues a run that was prematurely flipped to `Failed` by a batch-mate's terminal error (clears `last_failure` for that node, resets status to `Running`, and emits `node_recovered`).
- **Approval rollback attempt budget**: When an approval rollback re-queues upstream nodes, their `node_attempts` counters now reset. Previously a rolled-back ancestor inherited its prior attempt count, so its next run could hit max attempts mid-flight and cause `derive_terminal_run_state` to false-positive the whole run as failed.
- **Mid-execution failure false positive**: `derive_terminal_run_state` no longer flags a pending node as `failed` purely because its `attempts >= max_attempts`. It now also requires a terminal outcome in `node_outputs`, so a node whose latest attempt is still in flight doesn't get counted as exhausted.
- **Executor startup race**: `run_automation_v2_executor` now waits for the startup snapshot to report `Ready` before calling `recover_in_flight_runs`. The executor task no longer panics on `AppState::deref` when the runtime `OnceLock` isn't yet populated, which previously left queued runs stranded with no polling for the lifetime of the engine.
- **`Pausing` zombie workspace lock**: Automation v2 runs stuck in `Pausing` state across a restart are now settled to `Paused` at recovery time so they release their workspace lock. Previously a stale `Pausing` run from days ago could perpetually re-acquire its lock on every startup and block every new run on the same workspace.

### Deprecated

- **`TANDEM_AUTOMATION_V2_RUNS_RETENTION_DAYS`** (new env var): retention window for terminal runs in the hot automation runs file. Default `7`. Set to `0` to disable archiving entirely; set higher for longer hot-file retention.

## [0.4.30] - Released 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Codex account auth foundation**: Tandem can now treat `openai-codex` as a first-class provider with engine-owned OAuth session state instead of forcing everything through pasted API keys.
- **Local provider OAuth lifecycle**: Added provider OAuth authorize, callback, status, disconnect, PKCE/state handling, secure credential persistence, and refresh-aware auth state for local engine-backed Codex account sign-in.
- **Structured provider credential storage**: Provider auth is no longer limited to raw `provider_id -> token` storage. Tandem now supports typed API-key and OAuth credential records with expiry, account identity, and ownership metadata.
- **Control panel Codex connection flow**: The local Tandem control panel now exposes `Connect Codex Account`, browser-based sign-in, pending-state polling, connected-account display, reconnect, and disconnect actions.
- **Codex callback completion UI**: Successful browser sign-in now returns to a Tandem-branded completion page instead of a plain utility screen, making the account-connection handoff feel like part of the product.

### Changed

- **Provider auth model**: `/provider/auth` now exposes `auth_kind`, `status`, `connected`, `expires_at_ms`, `email`, and `managed_by`, allowing the UI to distinguish API-key auth from OAuth-backed account sessions.
- **Provider readiness logic**: Tandem now treats OAuth-backed providers as first-class configured providers rather than forcing API-key-only readiness assumptions.
- **OpenAI provider routing**: `openai-codex` now exists as its own provider/catalog entry with starter models, so Codex-account traffic can be separated cleanly from standard OpenAI API-key usage.
- **Settings guidance**: The control panel provider settings now explain Codex account auth separately from API-key auth and only expose the browser sign-in flow when the control panel is connected to a local engine.
- **Codex transport behavior**: `openai-codex` now routes through the Codex-specific ChatGPT backend and request shape instead of reusing the normal OpenAI API-key transport.

### Fixed

- **OpenRouter cost escape hatch**: Local Tandem installs can now route eligible work toward a connected Codex account instead of requiring OpenRouter-only paid usage for every heavy test loop.
- **Auth failure visibility**: Expired or invalid Codex OAuth sessions now fail closed with explicit `reauth_required` state instead of masquerading as a healthy saved-key configuration.
- **Browser secret handling**: Refresh-capable Codex credentials stay engine-owned; the control panel only initiates and observes the OAuth flow rather than persisting refresh tokens in browser state.
- **Codex backend compatibility**: Tandem now matches the Codex backend contract for responses requests, including the Codex-specific route, required `instructions`, `store: false`, and removal of unsupported fields such as `max_output_tokens`.
- **Codex tool schema compatibility**: Codex-bound tool definitions are now sanitized to remove root-level schema combinators that the Codex backend rejects, preventing browser-tool and MCP-heavy sessions from failing before execution.
- **Control panel default-provider behavior**: Connecting a Codex account now correctly promotes `openai-codex` for Tandem runs so chats and channel traffic stop silently falling back to quota-limited API-key providers.
- **Discord guild message intake**: Discord channel messages now survive empty `guild_id` config values, and guild-channel intake no longer silently black-holes messages while DMs continue to work.
- **Discord mention-only handling**: Mention-only Discord mode now cleanly accepts explicit mentions and reply-to-bot flows without dropping valid guild messages or surfacing raw Tandem Docs MCP errors for empty tool args.
- **Docs search MCP recovery**: `search_docs` calls now recover a missing `query` from the user’s prompt, preventing raw MCP 400s when the model picks the docs-search tool but omits the query field.

## [0.4.29] - Released 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Registry-backed channel lifecycle diagnostics**: Added a channel registry plus lifecycle diagnostics coverage so built-in channel listeners are discovered from the registry, surfaced with runtime state/error codes, and validated through the `/channels/*` endpoints instead of relying on hardcoded channel names.

### Changed

- **Control panel simplification**: Planner, Studio, Orchestrator, and other experimental surfaces are now hidden by default so new users land on the core experience first.
- **Automation surface cleanup**: The Automations view now centers on Create, Calendar, Library, and Run History, keeping Calendar visible as the scheduling surface while removing clutter from the primary path.
- **Workflow compiler prompt guidance**: Planner prompts now preserve exact source-file and output-file names, and keep explicit tools like `websearch` and `webfetch` visible in the step that uses them.
- **Generalized workflow scaffolding**: Fallback workflow plans now use descriptive domain-neutral step IDs such as `summarize_inputs`, `gather_supporting_sources`, `draft_deliverable`, and `finalize_outputs` instead of leaking narrow research-marketing scaffolds like `extract_pain_points` into unrelated workflows.

### Fixed

- **Brand icon rendering**: Tandem now uses the default icon asset in the shell and settings preview, and the rounded avatar frame no longer clips the logo.
- **Automation dry run cleanup**: Removed the non-functional dry-run affordances from the calendar cards, scope inspector, and mission builder so the available actions better reflect what actually works today.
- **Read-only source-of-truth protection**: The workflow runtime now snapshots protected inputs and restores them on failure, preventing source files like `RESUME.md` from being used as scratch space or left deleted after a bad attempt.
- **Concrete fallback workflow plans**: Fallback plan generation now keeps complex prompts grounded in concrete files and tools, so workflows that mention `RESUME.md`, `resume_overview.md`, `job_search_results_YYYY-MM-DD.md`, or web research no longer collapse into a generic triage scaffold.
- **Planner decomposition fidelity**: The decomposition scorer now treats explicit web research as a stronger planning signal, helping complex prompts expand into phase-aware microtask DAGs instead of single generic steps.
- **Repair guidance for exact source reads**: Repair briefs and API repair guidance now surface the exact missing source-file paths that must be read, helping blocked research nodes recover instead of looping on vague `required_source_paths_not_read` failures.
- **Channel endpoint validation**: Unknown channel names now return `404` from the channel config/status/verify routes, and listener supervision now reports restart and failure state through diagnostics instead of dropping the signal on the floor.
- **Channel registry follow-up hardening**: Registry-driven channel help/config paths now use the correct borrowed capability metadata and owned JSON string serialization, and listener startup correctly invokes per-channel security profile callbacks.

## [0.4.28] - Released 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- **Packaged desktop startup crash after engine-ready**: Installed Tauri builds no longer eagerly load the workflow calendar and diff viewer libraries during desktop startup, preventing the `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'cssRules')` frontend crash that blocked the PIN/login UI from appearing after the backend came up.
- **Desktop route-level code splitting**: The automation calendar and diff viewer now lazy-load only when those views are opened, keeping heavy CSS-in-JS and FullCalendar initialization out of the initial desktop boot path.

## [0.4.27] - Released 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- **Packaged desktop startup diagnostics**: The Tauri desktop app now boots through a lightweight startup loader before importing the full React workspace, so installed builds surface chunk-load and top-level frontend boot failures instead of hanging on the splash after the engine is ready.
- **Desktop startup signal hardening**: Frontend startup visibility and failure reporting now use shared bootstrap signals, making installed-build render failures observable on the splash screen rather than silently stalling behind a successful backend launch.

## [0.4.26] - Released 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- **Installed desktop startup recovery**: Tauri-packaged builds now dismiss the splash based on actual React DOM mount, not just frontend-ready events, so the app can no longer stay stuck on the "engine ready" splash after the backend has fully started.
- **Frontend boot failure visibility**: Desktop startup now surfaces JavaScript boot errors directly on the splash screen instead of hanging indefinitely behind a seemingly successful backend startup state.

## [0.4.25] - Released 2026-04-14

### Changed

- **LLM workspace search acceleration**: The built-in `grep` tool now uses the ripgrep library stack (`grep-searcher`, `grep-regex`, `grep-matcher`) for faster repository search while keeping the same tool name, schema, and output shape.
- **Parallel search streaming**: `grep` now streams partial match chunks through engine events while it searches, so the harness can show results sooner without changing the final tool output.

### Fixed

- **Desktop splash dismissal recovery**: The Windows startup splash now waits for both backend-ready and React-visible signals before dismissing, so a fully loaded engine can no longer leave the app stuck on the ready screen.
- **Crate publish preflight hardening**: Release publishing now validates local path-dependency order up front and includes `tandem-enterprise-contract` in the publish sequence, so missing publish-list entries fail before the release job starts pushing crates.

### Added

- **Automation engine stability overhaul** (Phases 5–8):
  - **Glob-loop circuit breaker**: Added `detect_glob_loop()` that fires a repair signal when `glob` is called ≥10 times without any `read`, or when total tool calls exceed 30 without any write. This prevents nodes from stalling indefinitely in discovery loops.
  - **Standup JSON extraction hardening**: Added `extract_recoverable_json_artifact_prefer_standup()` that prioritizes extracting JSON with `yesterday`/`today` keys from markdown fences, prose-prefixed text, or multi-object responses.
  - **Per-node tool-call budget**: Added `max_tool_calls: Option<u32>` field to `AutomationFlowNode` for future use.
  - **Persistent run status**: Added `persist_automation_v2_run_status_json()` that writes run status to `{workspace_root}/.tandem/runs/{run_id}/status.json` after every update, making debugging possible without server access.
  - **Auto-resume after stale reap**: Added `auto_resume_stale_reaped_runs()` that automatically re-queues paused stale runs with repairable nodes (up to 2 times per run), integrated into both single and multi scheduler loops.
  - **Reduced default node timeouts**: `StandupUpdate` nodes now default to 120s timeout (was 600s); `StructuredJson` nodes to 180s.
  - **Standup node max attempts**: StandupUpdate nodes now explicitly default to 3 attempts.
  - **Structured run diagnostics**: Added `tracing::info!` at the end of each automation run with run ID, final status, elapsed time, node counts, and resource usage.

## [0.4.24] - Released 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Enterprise transition groundwork**: added the public `/enterprise/status` surface, tenant-aware runtime propagation, and durable protected audit outbox coverage for approvals, provider secrets, MCP updates, workflow runs, and coder transitions.

- **Marketplace browse split**: The control panel marketplace is now browse-only and links out to tandem.ac, while the new internal contract docs define the public marketplace/server ownership split.

### Changed

- **Marketplace presentation**: The marketplace navigation now reads as an external bridge to tandem.ac instead of a local store surface.

### Fixed

- **Desktop unlock startup progress visibility**: The splash now listens to explicit backend startup events from vault unlock, keystore initialization, and sidecar boot so it stays on a live progress state instead of falling back to an empty waiting window.
- **Definitive workflow stability overhaul (Phases 1–4)**:
  - **Explicit completion signal always wins**: `node_output.rs` now prioritizes `{"status":"completed"}` JSON signals over all heuristic content scans. If a node emits that signal and the artifact is present on disk, the node is immediately marked completed regardless of what the artifact text contains (blocked-handoff phrases, test-failure language, or similar).
  - **Artifact-gate fallback completion**: Nodes whose status JSON is missing or unparseable are still marked completed if the artifact exists on disk and was produced in the current attempt window, preventing orphaned runs from hanging indefinitely after sidecar restarts.
  - **False-positive block suppression**: Secondary concrete-read audits and file-evidence content scans are now suppressed for nodes that already carry an explicit completed status, eliminating the class of false-positive `blocked` / `verify_failed` downgrades that could occur even after a model cleanly finished its work.
  - **Bootstrap inference guard for synthesis nodes**: `enforcement.rs` now skips the `automation_node_inferred_bootstrap_required_files` inference for terminal synthesis/analysis nodes (`brief`, `report_markdown`, `text_summary`, `citations`) that have upstream dependencies. These nodes do not need to re-discover workspace files; their upstream nodes already did that. Chained bootstrap nodes (`structured_json`) continue inferring requirements as before.
  - **Context-write path stripping for all node types**: `prompting_impl.rs` now strips internal `ctx:...` context-write IDs from upstream inputs for every node type, not just a specific subset. This prevents models from mistakenly treating those engine-internal identifiers as real filesystem write targets and hallucinating paths like `ctx:abc123`.
  - **Research node write-flow enforcement**: Added a `Next Step` hint to research node prompts when evidence gathering is complete and a required artifact is declared, explicitly instructing the model to call `websearch` first and then `write` the artifact — reinforcing the evidence-before-artifact contract without requiring a repeat repair cycle.
  - **Output-target exclusion from file requirements**: `must_write_files` no longer injects a node's own declared `output_targets` into its required-file list. A node should not be required to have its own output file present before it runs; that file is what it is supposed to create.

## [0.4.23] - Released 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- **Vault unlock startup safety net**: The desktop unlock flow now keeps the splash visible until the React app reports it is actually ready, and startup crashes show a visible recovery screen instead of a blank window.
- **Vault unlock critical path fix**: Vault unlock now returns immediately after the master key is restored, while keystore initialization and sidecar startup continue in the background. This prevents the unlock screen from getting stuck waiting on startup work.
- **Workflow stale-run recovery and operator actions**:
  - Automation node prompts now time out cleanly instead of hanging forever and holding the workspace lock.
  - Stale-run detection now uses live session activity, API `lastActivityAtMs` matches that session-aware view, and stale pauses mark in-flight nodes as repairable.
  - Recovering a stale-paused run now clears stale pending outputs and attempts so retries actually requeue work instead of immediately refailing.
  - The control panel no longer gets stuck hiding retry, continue, or resume actions behind stale pending run-action state.
- **MCP-backed citations grounding no longer false-blocks on local read gates**:
  - Citations nodes that explicitly target MCP grounding, such as `tandem-mcp` research steps, now validate as artifact-only instead of local workspace research.
  - This prevents recovered workflows from being blocked by incorrect `no_concrete_reads` / `local_research` enforcement when the node's real job is to capture MCP-grounded notes into the required artifact.

## [0.4.22] - Unreleased

### Added

- **Workflow import and workflow cohesion**: Durable bundle import now persists a planner session with provenance, validation, and an embedded draft, and the control panel now has a Workflow Center surface for browsing and reopening stored workflow sessions.
- **Agent workflow teaching**: Added a compact agent-facing operating manual and tightened the workflow/MCP docs so agents start with `mcp_list`, stop when required MCPs are missing, and treat import as durable session creation instead of automation arming.

- **Per-attempt forensic evidence**: Every automation attempt now generates a durable JSON forensic record, capturing full context for debugging and audit.
- **Explicit node file contracts**: Workflow nodes can now declare explicit `input_files` and `output_files` at authoring time, overriding heuristic workspace inspection and providing clearer contract enforcement.

### Changed

- **Stale run handling**: Stale automation runs are now paused instead of failed, using a new `last_activity_at_ms` timestamp for more accurate detection.
- **Capability resolution hardening**: The automation runtime now fails closed when required capabilities are missing after MCP sync, and clears stale tool failure labels on retry.
- **Provider transport failure classification**: Network and authentication issues during tool execution are now classified as `provider_transport_failure` instead of generic workflow errors.
- **Explicit completion now outranks heuristic content scans**: When a node returns structured `{"status":"completed"}` and the artifact exists, status classification now trusts that signal instead of overriding it with free-text blocked/verify-failed phrases or read-audit overreach.

### Fixed

- **Workflow import docs mismatch**: The workflow docs now match the implementation by describing `POST /workflow-plans/import` as durable planner-session creation instead of immediate workspace persistence or automation arming.
- **Clean-run workflow survival**: Write-required sessions no longer die on a fresh workspace just because the first `glob` returns empty; empty `glob` results now count as productive discovery and preparatory tool cycles get a retry instead of immediate termination.
- **False-positive blocked/verify_failed workflow states**: Report-style artifacts can now describe blocked upstream conditions or failed tests without being misclassified as blocked/verify_failed when the node explicitly completed.
- **Validation overreach on completed artifacts**: Structured completed outputs with materialized artifacts no longer get downgraded by secondary concrete-read heuristics or blocked-handoff cleanup logic.
- **MCP workflow scoping**: Automation runs now only surface `mcp_list` when MCP servers are explicitly selected, and the inventory snapshot is filtered to the allowed servers instead of leaking the full connector registry.
- **Inspect run UI crash**: Fixed a UI crash in the WorkflowRequiredActionsPanel when `blockedNodeIds` or `needsRepairNodeIds` were undefined.
- **Grey/dark screen after vault unlock on desktop**: Eliminated the 1-9+ second blank window that appeared immediately after entering the PIN on Tauri-packaged installs.
  - Added `check_sidecar_status_fast` — a new Tauri command that checks only the local binary (exists + ≥ 100 KB), with no GitHub API call.
  - `SidecarDownloader` now calls the fast-path command on startup (100 ms initial delay, down from 500 ms) and proceeds immediately when the binary is present; a background call to `check_sidecar_status` still detects available updates without blocking the app.
  - Replaced `spawn_blocking` + `block_on` with a proper `tauri::async_runtime::spawn` in the vault unlock background sidecar start path, preventing Tokio blocking-thread-pool starvation during sidecar process launch.

### Added

- **Connected-agent handoff documentation and UI wiring**:
  - Added `handoff_config`, `watch_conditions`, and `scope_policy` fields to the `WorkflowEditDraft` interface so the control panel can safely modify automations containing handoff artifacts without dropping those fields.
  - Added a dedicated `Connected-Agent Handoffs` guide covering inbox/approved directory layout, auto-approval toggles, watch conditions, and restricted-access scope policies.
  - Documented the new Handoffs tab in the Control Panel workflow edit dialog, bringing full visibility and management for artifact staging to the frontend.

- **Engine Security & Governance Hardening**:
  - Resolved 13 audit findings (including 2 critical sandbox/governance bypasses) across the core engine loop.
  - Fixed an issue where `batch` tool sub-calls could operate outside workspace boundaries and bypass permission/policy evaluations by properly inheriting and forwarding execution context.
  - Removed blanket local filesystem exemptions for MCP tools; added `TANDEM_MCP_SANDBOX_EXEMPT_SERVERS` for remote-only exceptions.
  - Enforced a 10-minute TTL maximum on workspace sandbox overrides, expanded sensitive path blocklists, and implemented deny-wins plugin permission precedence.
  - Prevented silent waiver of prewrite gates via `TANDEM_PREWRITE_GATE_STRICT=true`.

- **Standup Reporting Pipeline Infrastructure**:
  - Integrated `StandupUpdate` validator contracts, standup enforcement profiles, and strict filler rejection pipelines to guarantee high-quality non-meta-commentary reports.
  - Added delta-aware previous standup injection to prevent duplicate findings across daily reports by automatically retrieving prior reports up to 7 days back.
  - Formalized workspace-root output conventions so final standup deliverables are consistently placed in `outputs/` for immediate human discoverability.

### Changed

- **Workflow prompt repair guidance and filesystem bootstrap clarity**:
  - Strengthened required-artifact prompts so retry attempts explicitly rewrite the declared output, include full `write.content`, and avoid empty-path or empty-body writes.
  - Added explicit path guidance that file-like targets such as `.jsonl`, `.json`, and `.md` must be created as files, while only parent folders should be created as directories.
  - Updated monitor/triage prompt rendering so workspace inspection steps explicitly use `glob` and `read` when deciding whether downstream work should run.
  - Corrected the local control-panel build/restart test command in `docs/ENGINE_TESTING.md` so it returns to the repo root after restarting the service.

### Fixed

- **Workflow self-healing, retry classification, and artifact validation**:
  - Fixed triage-gate enforcement so assess-style nodes request and receive filesystem tools (`glob`, `read`) instead of getting stuck with MCP-only tool offers.
  - Fixed current-attempt artifact materialization tracking so promoted run-scoped outputs satisfy retry validation instead of being rejected as stale.
  - Fixed required-write failures (`TOOL_MODE_REQUIRED_NOT_SATISFIED`, `WRITE_REQUIRED_NOT_SATISFIED`) to surface as repairable workflow states when another attempt can still create the missing artifact.
  - Fixed generic artifact/editorial validation, missed code-workflow verification, and offered-but-unused email delivery stages to request repair instead of blocking immediately when the node can self-correct.
  - Fixed raw runtime data rewrites such as workflow ledger `.json` files from being misclassified as protected source-file rewrites.
  - Fixed workflow bootstrap guidance that previously led models to create file paths like `tracker/seen-jobs.jsonl` as directories.
  - Added regression coverage for the new self-healing paths, prompt guidance, JSON ledger writes, and required-output retry handling.

## [0.4.21] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Smart Heartbeat Monitor Automations**:
  - Added a monitor-pattern compiler prompt and a native Control Panel triage-first DAG pattern to replace high-token polling with cheap `has_work: false` gating.
  - Added `metadata.triage_gate: true` support and transitive `triage_skipped` propagation to the automation runtime so skipped nodes bypass execution and finish cleanly.
  - Refactored `agent_standup_compose` into a broader composition factory that also supports `compose_monitor` creation.
  - Added "Smart scheduling" detection and UX hints in the control panel to guide operators toward monitor-style automations when their input describes background checking tasks.
  - Added the `assess` step type to allowed planner IDs.

- **Shared Workflow Context**:
  - Added persisted context records plus publish/list/get/bind/revoke/supersede routes so approved shared workflow context can be published once and reused later with explicit bindings.
  - Added project allowlist visibility for Shared Workflow Context so explicit cross-project reuse can be opt-in instead of implied by default.
  - Added runtime expansion, scope-inspector surfacing, and control-panel binding flows so bound shared workflow contexts participate in automation runtime materialization instead of sitting only as metadata.
  - Added a Shared Workflow Context details drawer with provenance, freshness, manifest summaries, and bind history so operators can inspect reusable context before reuse.
  - Added copy-only suggestions for recent relevant shared workflow contexts in Scope Inspector, ranked by source-plan and title overlap, so operators can discover reuse candidates without auto-binding them.
  - Added superseded-context upgrade prompts in workflow review so existing bindings can be swapped to the replacement context with one click before saving.
  - Added explicit policy-hook events for publish, bind, revoke, and supersede so future authorization checks have a clear seam without introducing a new role model.
  - Added compile-time/runtime validation and regressions for revoked contexts, workspace mismatches, project mismatches, project-key list filtering, and scoped GET/read enforcement so the reuse path stays scoped and explicit.
  - Swept the shared-context UI copy to use Shared Workflow Context terminology consistently instead of the older pack wording.

- **Timezone-aware automation scheduling**:
  - Added reusable timezone helpers and timezone input fields to the control panel and desktop automation surfaces so schedule creation and editing can use the operator's local timezone instead of assuming UTC.
  - Added timezone visibility to workflow review surfaces so operators can confirm the final schedule context before saving or launching an automation.

### Changed

- **Tandem TUI modular slash-command extraction**:
  - Continued moving the remaining higher-risk slash-command families out of `app.rs` into `app/commands.rs`, including mission list/create/get/event flows, quick mission approval helpers, agent-team summary views, local bindings, agent-team approval reply helpers, preset index lookups, agent compose/summary/fork flows, automation preset summary/save flows, and agent-pane creation/switching/fanout orchestration commands.
  - Updated the TUI modularization kanban to reflect that the higher-risk slash-command extraction track is now complete and `TUI-201` is closed.
- **Tandem TUI plan-helper extraction**:
  - Moved question-draft parsing, task-payload normalization, plan fingerprint/preview generation, plan-feedback markdown rendering, assistant-text extraction, reconstructed-task replay, and context-todo sync helpers out of `app.rs` into `app/plan_helpers.rs`.
  - Rewired `app.rs` and `app/commands.rs` to use the new helper module while preserving existing plan-mode and approval-flow behavior.
- **Agent team template library and standup composition**:
  - Standardized agent-team template reads and writes around the global saved-agent workspace so standup composition can reuse saved personalities across workspaces instead of only within the active project root.
  - Extended the standup compose contract and client bindings to carry an explicit `model_policy` onto generated participant and coordinator agents.

### Fixed

- **Workflow MCP discovery and connector-backed research**:
  - Made workflow generation and execution explicitly surface MCP discovery when a prompt or node objective names connector-backed sources such as Reddit, GitHub issues, Slack, or Jira.
  - Added prompt guidance to call `mcp_list` before choosing connector-backed tools or falling back to generic web search, while keeping the injected MCP context compact instead of dumping the full registry into every prompt.
  - Added validation coverage so connector-backed work that never discovers available MCP tools is blocked instead of completing with guessed answers.
  - Added regression tests for planner prompt generation, runtime prompt rendering, and connector-backed intent detection.

- **Channel MCP permission refresh**:
  - Reapplied the channel permission template whenever a Telegram, Discord, or Slack session is reused so `mcp_list` and other `mcp*` tools no longer get stuck behind stale session permissions after a restart.
  - Allowed session PATCH updates to refresh permission rules and added regression coverage so channel sessions can recover MCP discovery without manually recreating the session.

- **Agent standup runtime startup and model selection**:
  - Fixed automation run startup so workflows that do not actually materialize runtime context are no longer failed up front for a missing runtime-context partition.
  - Fixed standup execution to resolve saved-agent templates from the global template library when the composed automation runs in a different workspace.
  - Fixed standup composition in explicit-model environments by adding a required provider/model picker in the control panel and stamping that selection directly onto every generated standup agent.

## [0.4.20] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- **Backend-backed coder planner sessions**:
  - Added persisted planner-session records and session-scoped endpoints so one project can hold multiple independent coding plans without a single giant thread.
  - Added a Chat-style planner session rail in the control panel with `New plan`, switch, rename, duplicate, and delete actions.
  - Added stale-plan recovery so expired `plan_id` drafts can be rehydrated from session state instead of leaving the coder planner stuck on 404s.
  - Added control-panel client smoke coverage plus backend CRUD/recovery tests for the new planner-session flow.
- **Tandem TUI exploration transcript summaries**:
  - Added durable exploration summaries that turn read/search/list tool bursts into compact transcript entries instead of leaving that work visible only in the live activity strip.
  - Added exploration-batch accumulation, burst-boundary flushing, and target-change splitting so long exploration runs can emit multiple focused summaries as the AI shifts between workspace areas.
  - Added an optional verbose exploration-summary fallback for debugging, allowing deeper target detail to be surfaced when `TANDEM_TUI_VERBOSE_EXPLORATION=1`.
  - Added snapshot-style and unit coverage for exploration summary wording, target-change segmentation, and grouped-exploration rendering.
- **Tandem TUI structured edit transcript cells**:
  - Added structured edit-result transcript cells that summarize file changes, aggregate add/remove counts, per-file change counts, tiny diff previews for low-volume edits, and applied/partial/failed outcome states.
  - Added consistent `Next` guidance blocks for edit transcript cells so operators can quickly decide whether to review diffs, inspect failures, or retry an edit.
  - Added snapshot-style regression coverage for applied, partial, and failed edit cells plus long-output truncation behavior.
- **Tandem TUI recent-command helper**:
  - Added `/recent`, `/recent run <index>`, and `/recent clear` so frequent terminal operators can list, replay, and clear recently used slash commands without retyping them.
  - Added regression coverage for recent-command ordering, replay behavior, and clear semantics.

### Changed

- **Tandem TUI transcript readability and operator guidance**:
  - Improved transcript event differentiation so tool-oriented system events and governance/operator-action-required events render with clearer badges instead of sharing one generic system treatment.
  - Improved long command/tool result rendering with stable head/tail truncation so operators can see both the opening context and the final output without flooding narrow terminals.
  - Added structured rollback transcript cells for preview, execute, and receipt flows so guarded rollback work now follows one compact terminal UX pattern with action badges, status summaries, and focused next steps.
  - Continued landing new TUI behavior in modular UI and activity files rather than growing `app.rs`, matching the current maintainability plan.
  - Continued extracting slash commands from `app.rs` into `app/commands.rs`, including session flows, provider-key helpers, queue/error helpers, local agent-control commands, basic task/prompt/title chat commands, the routine-management command family, config/request-center/clipboard/permission reply helpers, and the context-run command family.

### Fixed

- **Installed desktop startup black-screen after vault unlock**:
  - Added a bounded timeout to installed-build sidecar release discovery so a stalled GitHub metadata check cannot leave the desktop app hanging on a black screen after passcode unlock.
  - Hardened post-unlock startup routing so Tandem uses the actual configured workspace/provider state when deciding between onboarding and chat, avoiding stale-state redirects on desktop boot.
- **Desktop automation first-load and refresh latency**:
  - Reworked the automation page so the main load path waits only for automation overview data while provider, MCP, and tool catalogs load in the background or on demand for the Create tab.
  - Replaced per-automation run-history fan-out with a single bulk runs request, reducing refresh work for Calendar, My Automations, and Live Tasks.
  - Fixed workspace-root validation to accept Windows absolute paths in desktop automation flows instead of treating only Unix-style paths as valid.
- **Desktop automation MCP and model selection gaps**:
  - Merged configured global/project MCP servers with runtime MCP status so automation setup now shows connected configured servers even when runtime registration is delayed or incomplete.
  - Added provider/model catalog fallback loading from configured providers and discovered models so workflow and planner model selectors are no longer stuck on engine defaults when the runtime provider list is empty.
- **Desktop settings provider model lookup**:
  - Expanded provider model suggestions to merge live catalog entries, current values, curated fallbacks, and discovered Ollama models so typing in settings surfaces the fuller model list expected from the control panel flow.
  - Added native input suggestion backing for free-form provider model fields so large provider catalogs can be searched directly while preserving the existing inline picker behavior.

## [0.4.19] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed

- **Production desktop black-screen startup regression**:
  - Render the React app shell before bootstrapping persisted language preferences so a slow or stuck Tauri settings call cannot leave production builds on a blank window with an empty `#root`.
  - Keep language synchronization best-effort during startup instead of making initial desktop render depend on the settings store roundtrip.

## [0.4.18] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Task intake and routing boundary**:
  - Added a task-intake preview contract and HTTP endpoint for external orchestrators to normalize single tasks, grouped tasks, and GitHub Project items before routing them to coder or workflow surfaces.
  - Added task grouping signals, board-item normalization, and advisory route hints so grouped work can prefer mission preview without turning the mission planner into the coding loop.
- **Mission/workflow handoff hardening**:
  - Added explicit execution-kind markers and mission coder handoff summaries so mission/workflow nodes can distinguish coder-run work from governance steps.
  - Added regressions that preserve lane, phase, milestone, and launch metadata across mission preview and task-routing boundaries.
- **Workflow knowledge reuse and rollout guidance**:
  - Added first-class knowledge bindings, project-scoped preflight reuse, promotion lifecycle tracking, and audit reasons so workflows can reuse validated knowledge instead of redoing the same work.
  - Added planner and review guardrails that keep raw working state local, prefer project-scoped promoted knowledge, and surface rollout guidance for operators.
- **Context-run rollback audit and operator surfaces**:
  - Added rollback history summary, last rollback outcome, and rollback policy metadata to `GET /context/runs/:run_id` so clients can render audit state without replaying event history manually.
  - Added regression coverage for blocked rollback outcomes and required policy-ack metadata on context-run detail responses.
- **Desktop and terminal rollback operations visibility**:
  - Added rollback policy, audit, preview, receipt history, and guarded execute flows to the desktop developer run viewer, including linked context-run refresh after execution.
  - Added Tandem TUI rollback preview, rollback history, explicit rollback execute, and execute-all commands so terminal operators can inspect and run guarded rollback steps without leaving the TUI.

### Fixed

- **Desktop startup splash resilience**:
  - Made the unlock splash dismiss immediately after a successful vault unlock so slow or transient provider discovery cannot strand the app on the startup screen.
  - Stopped boot-time sidecar startup from silently rewriting the selected provider/default-provider state, reducing startup regressions caused by stale or slow provider config.
- **`tandem-engine` fast-release build regression**:
  - Restored `cargo build -p tandem-ai --profile fast-release` by adding the missing `tandem-server` library surface expected by the engine binary.
  - Re-exported the required server/runtime helpers through the new library entrypoint so engine builds no longer fail with unresolved `tandem_server` imports.

## [0.4.17] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Automation Modularization & Scaling**:
  - Extracted and modularized the automation engine into dedicated modules: `types`, `lifecycle`, `path_hygiene`, `rate_limit`, `scheduler`, `assessment`, `extraction`, `verification`, `upstream`, `enforcement`, and `node_output`.
  - Implemented a new multi-run scheduler with a `JoinSet`-based supervisor, capacity capping, and workspace-root locking.
  - Added a `PreexistingArtifactRegistry` (MWF-300) to enable efficient artifact reuse during retries and server restarts.
  - Integrated per-provider rate limiting into the scheduler admission logic to prevent cascading failures.
  - Exposed core scheduler metrics (active/queued runs, admitted/completed totals, wait time histograms) via a new `/api/system/scheduler/metrics` endpoint.
  - Added panic recovery and server-restart recovery for automation runs to ensure continuity.
- **File Governance & Codebase Health**:
  - Added `scripts/check-file-sizes.sh` for line-count baseline generation and tracking.
  - Added `scripts/ci-file-size-check.sh` for CI-time file-size enforcement (1500-line threshold for touched files).
  - Established an initial file-size baseline in `docs/internal/file-size-baseline.csv`.
- **Workflow Plan Governance & Compiler Boundary**:
  - Added overlap analysis and confirmation handling to workflow-plan preview, chat, get, and apply flows, including persisted overlap decision history and control-panel review UI.
  - Added compiler-owned approved-plan materialization helpers and manual-trigger record stamping so plan-governance transforms no longer have to live in `tandem-server`.
  - Added overlap-history rendering in the workflow scope inspector so prior reuse, merge, fork, and new decisions are searchable and auditable.
- **Governed Context and Bundle Parity**:
  - Added a first-class `ContextObject` design and runtime wiring for governed mission context, including scope, policy, freshness, provenance, and validation state.
  - Added bundle/export roundtrips that preserve revision, scope snapshot, connector binding resolution, model routing, budget enforcement, and approved-plan materialization metadata together.
  - Added runtime credential-envelope and context-partition handoff so routine execution stays compartmentalized while still inheriting the right mission context.
- **Operator Visibility for Approval, Budget, and Routing**:
  - Added explicit inspector and calendar visibility for approval readiness, lifecycle state, budget hard-limit behavior, overlap history, and per-step model routing.
  - Added connector suggestion and edit affordances so unresolved bindings are surfaced as actionable operator work instead of being guessed implicitly.
- **Mission Builder Preview Visibility**:
  - Added compiled mission-spec preview panels in desktop, control-panel, and template mission builders showing mission identity, entrypoint, phase counts, milestone counts, and success criteria.
  - Added compiled work-item preview cards across those mission builders, including assigned agent, dependency, and phase/lane/milestone metadata.

## [0.4.16] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- **Shared agent catalog for Tandem desktop and control panel**:
  - Added a generated catalog built from `awesome-codex-subagents` so Tandem uses one canonical source for role metadata.
  - Added searchable category/group browsing across both desktop Tauri and the control panel, including name, category, tag, filename, and source-path lookup.
  - Added Tandem-native agent manifests that omit per-agent model fields by default and keep only the runtime instructions plus lightweight metadata.
  - Added desktop and control-panel entry points for browsing the catalog and reusing agent roles from workflow authoring surfaces.
- **ACA-backed coding dashboard flow in the control panel**:
  - Added authenticated `/api/aca/*` proxying plus ACA token env support so the control panel can talk to ACA project, run, log, summary, and SSE APIs through the server.
  - Added ACA-backed GitHub Project board and task-intake views with on-demand GitHub refresh, project registration, single-task launch, and multi-select batch launch from the coding page.
  - Added ACA-aware run detail, log, and execution-history surfaces plus tests for ACA proxy routing and capability integration.
- **Calendar-first automations scheduling in the control panel**:
  - added a weekly calendar view for workflow automations with FullCalendar-based overlap handling and click-through editing
  - added drag/reschedule support for simple cron-backed automation slots plus UTC occurrence expansion for recurring runs
  - added week-to-day calendar drill-down, focused time-slot navigation, and visible `+N more` overlap counts for crowded schedule slots
  - added a shared guided schedule builder for automation creation and workflow editing so operators can pick times, weekdays, monthly dates, and repeat intervals without writing cron by hand
  - added a shared provider/model selector component reused across automation and mission-builder editing surfaces
- **Desktop Tauri automation calendar and schedule-builder parity**:
  - added a desktop `Calendar` tab for workflow automations with week/day views, overlap counts, drill-down, and click-to-edit behavior
  - added drag/reschedule support for simple cron-backed desktop calendar entries through the existing automation update flow
  - added the guided schedule builder to desktop create and workflow edit flows so desktop users can configure recurring schedules without writing raw cron by default
- **Operator search diagnostics in control-panel settings**:
  - added a `Test search` action in Web Search settings that runs the live engine `websearch` tool and renders a markdown result preview below the form
  - clarified hosted Tandem search versus self-hosted SearXNG URL fields directly in the settings UI

### Changed

- **Control-panel workflow polish and naming cleanups**:
  - Updated the coding dashboard so GitHub Project board state and ACA execution history are separated more clearly, with per-project column visibility and safer launch gating for non-launchable items.
  - Renamed Team/approval labels to `Active Teams` in automations surfaces for clearer operator-facing wording.
  - Replaced direct `crypto.randomUUID()` mission/workstream/review token generation in the advanced mission builder with a browser-safe helper fallback.
  - moved the custom OpenAI-compatible provider form into the provider catalog so it behaves like the rest of the provider list instead of rendering as a separate default card
  - updated the coding board layout to use the full page width, with run detail and live logs moved below the board and collapsed by default
  - improved planner UX in Coding Workflows with visible in-flight status, disabled regenerate/revise controls during active requests, and a longer client timeout for planner chat requests
  - improved Web Search settings handling of legacy Exa key env names so older installs do not silently lose builtin `websearch`
  - improved workflow debugger blocker details with surfaced blocker category, prompt preflight budget, missing capabilities, MCP tool inventory, and per-node attempt evidence
  - made control-panel health/status polling and engine actions treat restart-style gateway failures as transient info states instead of immediate hard errors
  - tightened chat panel and app-shell layout behavior for long pages and scrolling transcripts
  - added a `fast-release` Cargo profile and updated local engine-testing docs to prefer that faster iterative build path over full release builds

### Fixed

- **Planner authentication failure clarity**:
  - fixed workflow planner revision failures to classify provider-auth errors like `User not found`, `unauthorized`, and invalid API keys explicitly instead of collapsing them into generic invalid-response clarifiers
  - aligned session dispatch error classification with those provider-auth failure signatures
- **Automation MCP delivery availability and diagnostics**:
  - fixed automation MCP server selection so wildcard tool access and email-delivery nodes can sync enabled MCP servers before capability resolution instead of silently running with no MCP tools available
  - expanded email capability detection beyond `email`/`gmail` naming heuristics to include broader mail-provider/tool families and added targeted coverage for those matches
  - added delivery-specific diagnostics that report selected MCP servers, remote MCP tools, registered tool-registry tools, and discovered/offered email-like tools when `notify_user` blocks
- **Workflow board task projection consistency**:
  - fixed control-panel workflow task projection so context-run steps and blackboard workflow tasks canonicalize onto the same `node-*` ids instead of rendering duplicate pending/done copies of the same node
  - fixed current-step and dependency projection to use the same canonical workflow ids, reducing false “pending” cards after retries when upstream steps are already complete
- **Automation artifact-path sandbox failures**:
  - fixed automation-node prompt rendering so inline `metadata.inputs` are surfaced directly to the executing agent instead of forcing input discovery through undeclared temp files
  - added workspace-local default artifact paths for standard automation handoff nodes, preventing `/tmp/...` read/write attempts from tripping the workspace sandbox
  - added regression coverage for prompt rendering with inline inputs and for default artifact-path assignment on standard workflow nodes
- **Brave websearch request handling**:
  - fixed Brave `websearch` requests to avoid forcing gzip encoding and to parse from response text before JSON decoding, preventing valid Brave responses from collapsing into generic backend-unavailable failures
  - added targeted Brave normalization coverage so representative Brave web result payloads keep rendering correctly after the parser change
- **Chat GitHub URL misclassification**:
  - fixed control-panel chat setup-intent interception so pasted GitHub URLs pass through normal chat instead of incorrectly prompting operators to install GitHub MCP
  - added regression coverage for plain GitHub URL and `read this <url>` chat prompts while preserving the real integration-setup intercept path

## [0.4.15] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **Control panel ACA/Hal900 integration with optional feature gating**:
  - Added `/api/capabilities` endpoint returning `{ aca_integration, coding_workflows, missions, agent_teams, coder, engine_healthy, cached_at_ms }` with 45-second in-memory cache
  - Added `ACA_BASE_URL`, `ACA_HEALTH_PATH`, `ACA_PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS`, `ACA_CAPABILITY_CACHE_TTL_MS` environment variables to server config
  - ACA probe uses 5-second timeout; failures increment `aca_probe_error_counts` by reason bucket
  - Capability transitions (ACA availability and engine health) are logged to console with ISO timestamps

- **`useCapabilities` React Query hook**:
  - `useCapabilities()` hook in `src/features/system/queries.ts` with 60-second refetch, 30-second stale time
  - All ControlPanel pages now gate queries on `coding_workflows === true` via React Query `enabled` flag
  - `CodingWorkflowsPage` shows non-blocking callout when engine is absent: "External ACA (Hal900) not detected. Using engine-native autonomous coding."

- **ACA-specific UI panels now feature-flagged behind `aca_integration`**:
  - `AgentStandupBuilder` in `TeamsPage` — entire card hidden when `aca_integration === false`
  - `AdvancedMissionBuilderPanel` in `AutomationsPage` — shows amber callout when ACA absent; renders normally when available
  - All other ControlPanel pages (Studio, MCP, Memory, Packs, Channels) remain fully functional when ACA is absent

- **Observability instrumentation for ACA/engine capability monitoring**:
  - `capability_detect_duration_ms` emitted via `GET /api/capabilities` under `_internal`
  - `GET /api/capabilities/metrics` returns `detect_duration_ms`, `detect_ok`, `last_detect_at_ms`, `aca_probe_error_counts` (keyed by reason: `aca_not_configured`, `aca_endpoint_not_found`, `aca_probe_timeout`, `aca_probe_error`, `aca_health_failed_xxx`)
  - `GET /api/system/orchestrator-metrics` returns `streams_active`, `streams_total`, `events_received`, `stream_errors` for SSE stream monitoring
  - SSE client metrics via `getSseMetrics()`: `channels.open`, `channels.total`, `events_received`, `errors_total`

- **Unit and integration tests for capability routing**:
  - `tests/capabilities.test.mjs` — 8 test cases covering all ACA/engine probe scenarios (all passing)
  - `tests/capabilities-integration.test.mjs` — integration tests for engine-up/ACA-absent and engine-down paths

- **Load test scripts for run throughput and multi-worker fan-out**:
  - `scripts/loadtest/run_concurrency.mjs` — concurrent run concurrency test via session → run → SSE stream
  - `scripts/loadtest/run_fanout.mjs` — multi-mission multi-worker fan-out via agent-team/mission APIs
  - Both scripts moved from `tools/loadtest/` to `scripts/loadtest/`

- **Browser automation docs clarified for SDK and agent usage**:
  - documented that browser control is exposed through engine tools like `browser_open` and `browser_click`, not dedicated `/browser/open`-style HTTP endpoints
  - added guidance for Python SDK users to call browser automation via `execute_tool(...)` or session runs with browser tool allowlists
  - added QA-agent guidance for passing browser tools through the engine tool allowlist after checking `browser_status`

### Fixed

- **`browser_wait` tool argument parsing and docs alignment**:
  - fixed the engine-side `browser_wait` parser so it accepts the canonical `condition: { kind, value }` payload plus common agent-generated variants like `wait_for`, `waitFor`, camelCase fields, and top-level `selector`, `text`, or `url`
  - aligned the registered `browser_wait` tool schema with the accepted argument shapes so agents see the same contract the engine enforces
  - added guide examples showing copy-paste-safe `browser_wait` payloads for CLI, SDK, and QA-agent usage

## [0.4.14] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed

- **Windows desktop startup hotfix for Tauri installs (`ENGINE_STARTUP_FAILED`, `os error 5`)**:
  - fixed a Windows-specific storage flush edge where atomic temp-file replacement could fail with `Access is denied. (os error 5)` during startup metadata compaction
  - `tandem-core` storage flush now uses a Windows-safe replace fallback (`remove existing destination` then `rename temp`) when direct rename replacement is denied
  - added a regression test covering temp-file replacement over an existing storage JSON target to prevent startup regressions on Windows desktop/Tauri flows
- **Tauri orchestration run list filtering and active-count correctness**:
  - fixed context-run listing to include only known orchestration run types (`interactive`, `scheduled`, `cron`) instead of coercing unknown run types into orchestrator runs
  - fixed chat header active orchestration badge (`ORCH`) to count only active runs sourced from `orchestrator`, preventing inflated counts immediately after app startup
- **Custom OpenAI-compatible provider chat compatibility (MiniMax / control-panel chat)**:
  - fixed OpenAI-compatible custom-provider request normalization so multiple Tandem-injected `system` messages are collapsed into one leading system message before `chat/completions` dispatch
  - fixes control-panel chat failures for MiniMax-style OpenAI-compatible endpoints that rejected Tandem's previous message ordering with errors like `invalid message role: system (2013)`
  - preserves the standard OpenAI-compatible request shape for custom providers while keeping Tandem prompt/context instructions intact

## [0.4.13] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- **Safer secret handling for remote MCP servers and channel integrations**:
  - remote MCP server configs now support persisted non-secret headers plus secret-backed headers, including store-backed and env-backed secret references
  - Tandem now keeps channel bot tokens off persisted config JSON and rehydrates them from the secure auth store at runtime
  - existing plaintext MCP auth headers and channel bot tokens are migrated off disk automatically the next time config/state is loaded

### Fixed

- **Control-panel MCP configuration ergonomics**:
  - fixed the MCP built-in pack catalog layout so server rows no longer get vertically squashed inside the modal
  - added arbitrary extra MCP header rows in the control panel and panel template so remote MCP servers can send more than one header
  - added GitHub MCP toolset controls in the built-in GitHub pack, defaulting `X-MCP-Toolsets` to `default` while allowing operators to add values like `projects`
- **Provider defaults support for custom OpenAI-compatible providers**:
  - added control-panel and panel-template controls for configuring custom provider IDs, base URLs, default models, and optional API keys directly from Settings
- **Secret persistence bugs for MCP and channel auth**:
  - remote MCP bearer tokens and similar auth headers are no longer written back to persisted JSON state in plaintext
  - channel bot tokens for Telegram, Discord, and Slack are no longer persisted in plaintext config files
  - internal secret IDs used for MCP and channel auth are filtered out of normal provider-auth listings so they do not leak into general provider settings UIs

## [0.4.12] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed

- **Custom provider routing in `tandem-engine` CLI**:
  - `tandem-engine run`, `serve`, and `parallel` now accept custom provider IDs instead of rejecting anything outside the built-in provider list
  - custom OpenAI-compatible providers configured through engine config can now be selected directly without having to masquerade as `openai`
- **OpenAI-compatible URL preservation when env auth is present**:
  - provider env bootstrap no longer overwrites an explicitly configured `providers.<id>.url` just because an API key env var is set
  - fixes cases where OpenAI-compatible endpoints such as MiniMax were silently routed back to `https://api.openai.com/v1` when `OPENAI_API_KEY` was present

## [0.4.11] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- **Per-channel tool scope for channel sessions**:
  - added persisted per-channel tool preferences for Telegram, Discord, and Slack sessions, including built-in tool toggles plus MCP server allowlisting
  - added desktop Settings controls for channel tool scope so operators can manage built-ins and MCP servers without relying only on slash commands
  - added control-panel and panel-template Settings controls for the same per-channel tool scope workflow
  - added TypeScript and Python SDK coverage for channel security profiles, channel verification, and per-channel tool preference reads and updates
- **Public channel security profiles for channel integrations**:
  - added per-channel `security_profile` support across Telegram, Discord, and Slack config, API, desktop settings, and panel settings
  - added a hardened `public_demo` mode that blocks workspace/file access, shell access, MCP access, model/config/operator commands, and tool-scope widening for public-facing channels
  - updated `/help` in `public_demo` channels so disabled commands are still shown in a dedicated security section, making Tandem’s broader capabilities visible without exposing them
  - added quarantined public memory for `public_demo`, scoped to a channel-specific public project namespace instead of trusted project/global memory
  - unified public `/memory` commands with the same semantic-memory backend used by engine memory tools so public channel memory reads, writes, and deletes stay inside the same quarantine boundary

### Fixed

- **Desktop/Tauri and docs follow-ups for post-0.4.10 channel work**:
  - fixed the `src-tauri` sidecar integration so channel tool preference endpoints compile cleanly and can be reached from the desktop app
  - fixed `src-tauri` orchestrator session creation after `CreateSessionRequest` gained `project_id`
  - updated tool reference docs so docs parity includes the new `memory_delete` tool

## [0.4.10] - 2026-03-21

### Added

- **Initial coding workflows section in the control panel**:
  - added a new `Coding` navigation entry and an initial Coding Workflows page for internal run visibility
  - added an early dashboard surface for coding-run summaries, board-oriented workflow views, manual-task scaffolding, and integration visibility
- **GitHub Projects MCP bootstrap improvements**:
  - documented and wired the Tandem-native GitHub MCP path so GitHub Projects can auto-bootstrap from PAT-backed auth without relying on a separate `gh` adapter
  - clarified the engine-first guidance for GitHub Projects so client work stays on top of the built-in MCP integration instead of inventing a second adapter layer
- **Control-panel packaging and runtime support**:
  - added Dockerfiles, entrypoints, and `docker-compose` support for the control panel and engine
  - added control-panel packaging/runtime files so published installs include the `lib/` and `server/` assets the CLI expects

### Fixed

- **Control-panel package runtime completeness**:
  - the published control-panel package now includes the runtime `lib/` and `server/` files its CLI expects, avoiding broken installs where the app bootstraps without its own server helpers

## [0.4.9] - 2026-03-21

### Added

- **GitHub Projects intake for Tandem Coder**:
  - added engine-owned GitHub Project binding, schema discovery, schema fingerprinting, and root-lineage linkage so GitHub Projects can act as coder intake plus outward visibility without becoming Tandem's scheduler
  - added project-scoped coder HTTP routes for loading/saving bindings, listing a GitHub Project inbox, and ingesting a project item into a Tandem-native `issue_triage` coder run
  - added MCP capability bindings plus server-side discovery/update adapters for GitHub Project read/list/update flows, including schema-drift detection, idempotent project-item intake, and remote sync-state tracking
  - added backend regression coverage for binding discovery, inbox projection, and duplicate-intake protection
  - added desktop Coder UI support for connecting a GitHub Project, reviewing inbox items, intaking issue-backed TODO items, and viewing GitHub Project linkage from run detail
  - added TypeScript and Python SDK support for the new coder project binding, inbox, and intake APIs
  - added engine-testing and SDK docs plus internal rollout kanban coverage for the GitHub Project intake flow

## [0.4.8] - 2026-03-21

- **AutoResearch optimization control surfaces**:
  - Tandem's AutoResearch surfaces are explicitly inspired by Andrej Karpathy's `karpathy/autoresearch` project, with Tandem adapting the core overnight-eval loop to validator-backed workflow optimization
  - added optimization campaign list and experiment-list HTTP surfaces plus explicit approved-winner apply route for workflow prompt/objective optimization campaigns
  - added first-pass AutoResearch support in the TypeScript and Python SDKs, including experiment listing, campaign actions, and winner-apply helpers
  - added an `Optimize` tab to the web control panel Automations page with campaign creation, campaign detail, experiment inspection, and approve/reject/apply controls
- **Studio workflow builder in the control panel**:
  - added a new top-level `Studio` page for template-first multi-agent workflow design
  - added starter workflow templates, editable per-agent role prompts, stage/dependency editing, and saved Studio workflow cards
  - added a shared workspace browser in Studio so workflow roots use the same folder-picker flow as the rest of the app
- **Workflow run recovery controls and richer node metadata**:
  - added `Continue` / `Continue From Here` for blocked `automation_v2` runs and `Retry` / `Retry Workflow` actions in the Run Debugger
  - added semantic node output metadata for `status`, `blocked_reason`, `approved`, tool telemetry, and artifact-validation results
- **Split staged research pipelines for bundled Studio templates**:
  - split bundled research-heavy Studio templates into explicit discover, local-source, external-research, and finalize stages so agents cannot jump straight from filename discovery into a generic artifact write
  - saved Studio workflows created from those bundled templates now auto-migrate in place to `workflow_structure_version = 2` while preserving automation ids and the original final research node ids used by downstream nodes
  - final staged research writers now validate against upstream blackboard/node-output evidence instead of requiring same-node `read` and `websearch` telemetry to be repeated at artifact-write time
- **Repo coding backlog task operations**:
  - projected coding backlog items can now be claimed and manually requeued through `automation_v2` run APIs instead of remaining read-only debugger projections
  - added stale-lease handling in the shared context-task runtime so expired `in_progress` backlog tasks automatically return to the runnable queue before the next claim
  - surfaced backlog claim/requeue controls plus lease-expiry and stale-state visibility in the control-panel Run Debugger
- **Agent context component manifests**:
  - added first-party component manifests for Tandem engine, desktop, TUI, control panel, and SDK clients under `manifests/components/`
  - bundled matching agent-context manifest copies into the desktop resources so runtime agents can use the same conservative component map
- **Runtime-owned external action receipts**:
  - added a shared `ExternalActionRecord` contract plus `/external-actions` read APIs for outbound action receipts, idempotency keys, targets, approval state, and receipt metadata
  - Bug Monitor GitHub publishes now mirror into the shared external-action path while keeping the existing Bug Monitor post APIs intact
  - coder real PR submit and merge submit now also emit shared external-action receipts linked back to the canonical coder context run
  - workflow hook and manual workflow actions that map to a bound outbound capability now emit the same shared external-action receipts, linked to the canonical workflow context run and visible in workflow action outputs
  - publish-style `automation_v2` nodes now emit shared external-action receipts for successful bound outbound tool calls, linked to the canonical automation context run and surfaced in node outputs
  - scheduled `automation_v2` runs now create their canonical context runs before outbound receipts are recorded, so `/external-actions` links are immediately dereferenceable even for scheduler-owned runs
  - `automation_v2` outbound receipt identity is now attempt-aware, so retried publish nodes preserve distinct receipt history instead of overwriting an earlier attempt
- **Context memory with tiered L0/L1/L2 layers** (inspired by OpenViking):
  - added `ContextUri` module with virtual filesystem-style URI scheme (`tandem://user/{user_id}/memories`, `tandem://session/{session_id}`, etc.)
  - added `memory_nodes` and `memory_layers` database tables for hierarchical context storage
  - added L0/L1/L2 tiered context loading: L0 (~100 tokens) for fast filtering, L1 (~2000 tokens) for decision-making, L2 for full content
  - added `ContextLayerGenerator` for LLM-based automatic layer generation from content
  - added directory recursive retrieval with intent analysis for smarter context retrieval
  - added `RetrievalTrajectory` for full observability of retrieval operations (which nodes visited, scores calculated, paths chosen)
  - added `SessionDistiller` for automatic extraction of facts, preferences, and learnings from session conversations
  - added new HTTP routes: `/memory/context/resolve`, `/memory/context/tree`, `/memory/context/layers/generate`, `/memory/context/distill`
  - added TypeScript and Python SDK methods for context memory: `contextResolveUri()`, `contextTree()`, `contextGenerateLayers()`, `contextDistill()`

### Changed

- **AutoResearch baseline replay and apply flow now has engine-owned runtime state**:
  - approved optimization winners now persist a structured apply patch and can be applied back to the saved live workflow with targeted drift checks and apply audit metadata
  - optimization campaigns can now reconcile completed baseline replay runs without manual replay bookkeeping, re-establish baseline metrics, and queue follow-up replay runs automatically when a baseline is still incomplete
  - once a campaign has a stable phase-1 baseline, the optimizer can now generate one deterministic bounded candidate at a time, queue a candidate eval run, ingest the completed run metrics, and surface promotion recommendations without manually seeding experiment records
  - unattended phase-1 candidate evaluation now respects `max_consecutive_failures`, marking the campaign failed when repeated candidate evals terminate unsuccessfully
- **Session and coder runs now point at one canonical journal**:
  - interactive session runs now create deterministic `session-<sessionID>` context runs before `contextRunID` is returned, so replay/debug links do not race durable state creation
  - added a session context-run journal bridge that maps `session.run.started`, `message.part.updated`, and `session.run.finished` into durable context-run lineage
  - coder worker-session artifacts and downstream approval/review payloads now carry durable worker-session context-run ids alongside transient session ids
- **Managed worktree isolation is now runtime-owned**:
  - raw `/worktree` flows now allocate deterministic managed worktrees under `.tandem/worktrees` with lease validation, cleanup on release/expiry, and managed-path boundary enforcement
  - coder workers and agent-team child sessions now run in manager-issued isolated worktrees for real git repos instead of sharing one mutable workspace by convention
  - failure-path cleanup now removes managed worktrees even when coder or child-session setup fails before the happy-path teardown
- **Automation output validation is now an explicit contract**:
  - `automation_v2` output contracts now declare validator kinds explicitly, and node outputs persist validator kind plus a typed validator summary instead of relying on ad hoc inference alone
  - mission builder, workflow planner, and standup composer now emit explicit validator intent for research, review, structured JSON, and generic artifacts
  - `automation_v2` read APIs now normalize older node outputs to the current validator contract so operator views converge on one interpretation
  - `automation_v2` output contracts now also support explicit `enforcement` metadata for required tools, evidence requirements, required sections, prewrite gates, retry policy, terminal conditions, repair budgets, and session-text recovery behavior
  - Studio workflow authoring, mission builder compilation, and workflow planner defaults now emit or backfill this enforcement contract so runtime behavior follows the authored node contract instead of hidden validator heuristics
  - research brief validation now treats citation presence and `Web sources reviewed` structure as first-class source-coverage requirements, emits typed `citations_missing` / `web_sources_reviewed_missing` unmet requirements, and surfaces citation/source summary fields directly in `artifact_validation` and `automation_v2` run payloads
  - workflow planner and mission builder now preserve explicit `metadata.builder.web_research_expected` intent into compiled `AutomationV2Spec` research nodes, and both authoring paths backfill that metadata for research brief steps so web-source coverage expectations are declared in authoring metadata instead of only inferred at validation time
  - `GenericArtifact` validation now blocks weak `report_markdown` and `text_summary` outputs with explicit editorial unmet requirements, typed `editorial_quality_failed` failures, `editorial_validation` phase classification, and structural summary fields like heading/paragraph counts in `artifact_validation`
  - publish/outbound nodes now inherit upstream editorial failure as a runtime-owned `editorial_clearance_required` block, and external-action receipts are skipped while that publish QA block is active
- **Evidence-gated workflow nodes now use a stricter repair spine**:
  - artifact-producing nodes with unmet prewrite requirements now emit structured repair attempt metadata and terminate with explicit `PREWRITE_REQUIREMENTS_EXHAUSTED` blocked state when bounded repair retries are exhausted
  - research/editorial artifact validation now propagates repair attempt counts, attempts remaining, and exhaustion state into `artifact_validation`, validator summaries, and workflow lifecycle metadata
  - research brief workflows now treat missing reads, citations, and web coverage as visible validation warnings by default; hard blocking/repair enforcement only kicks in when a node explicitly sets `metadata.builder.source_coverage_required = true`
  - `automation_v2` terminal run status now derives from blocked/failed node outputs instead of trusting checkpoint `blocked_nodes` alone, so blocked research nodes no longer surface as completed runs
  - the control-panel Run Debugger now derives blocked/failed status from workflow node outputs as a guardrail and shows repair-attempt progress when backend status and node reality disagree
  - evidence-repair passes now temporarily remove `write` tools and expose only the still-missing inspection/research tools, so a node that wrote too early must gather the missing evidence before it can reach the next write pass
  - evidence-repair followups that still skip the required reads or web research now stay inside the repair loop instead of immediately bouncing back into another write-required retry, making repeated premature-write failures exhaust cleanly instead of looping vaguely
  - prewrite repair retries now degrade gracefully instead of killing the session: when all repair attempts are exhausted the prewrite gate is waived and the model gets one final iteration with `write` unlocked and a clear prompt to produce the best output it can with whatever evidence it gathered, so sessions always produce an artifact for the post-session validator to evaluate
  - runtime enforcement now resolves from `output_contract.enforcement` first, then legacy builder metadata, then validator defaults, so repair semantics no longer depend on one research-brief-only path
  - session-text artifact recovery now respects the resolved enforcement contract instead of always restoring the strongest prior write, preventing blocked or under-evidenced nodes from silently overwriting declared outputs on disk
  - write-required nodes that complete tool use with an empty provider completion now get one bounded follow-up retry that points at the declared output target or the next missing evidence action, reducing stuck runs that previously ended in a synthetic no-output completion
  - synthetic empty-completion summaries are now mined for fallback tool telemetry, so auth-blocked `websearch` attempts still surface as attempted-unavailable research instead of disappearing as “tool not used”
  - research nodes that write a blocked handoff placeholder now restore the prior artifact or remove the placeholder from disk instead of leaving the blocked file behind as the run’s accepted output
  - `force_write_only_retry` is now disabled for nodes with active prewrite requirements so the write-required retry path cannot strip research tools from a node that still needs them
  - prewrite repair tool filtering now includes `glob` alongside `read` when `concrete_read_required` is unmet, so the model can re-discover valid file paths after a failed `read` instead of being stuck without a path-discovery tool
  - the post-write tool gate now allows up to three productive writes before locking out the `write` tool, preventing single-write sessions from trapping the model when the first write was a partial draft
  - the write-required retry prompt no longer instructs the model to avoid `glob`, `read`, or `websearch`; it now encourages finishing the write using previously gathered research while permitting re-reads for accuracy
  - control-panel `Retry` / `Continue` buttons on workflow runs are now hidden while the executor is actively processing repair retries, so operators only see manual intervention options when the run genuinely needs human input
- **More authoring surfaces now compile into `AutomationV2Spec`**:
  - `skills_compile` now emits an additive `automation_preview` for installed skill workflows by compiling `workflow.yaml` recipes through the shared `WorkflowPlan -> AutomationV2Spec` path
  - installed `pack_builder_recipe` skills no longer stop at an abstract execution summary; they now expose the same runtime-spec preview shape as the other automation authoring surfaces
  - workflow registry list/get surfaces now also expose additive `automation_preview` payloads compiled through the same shared plan compiler
  - pack-builder apply now persists a mirrored `AutomationV2Spec` alongside the existing routine wrapper, reports the registered automation ids in its apply result, and keeps that mirrored automation paused until the routine wrapper delegates into the canonical runtime so one pack does not register two active schedules
  - live workflow execution now mirrors manual runs and hook dispatches into linked `automation_v2` specs/runs, and workflow run records now surface `automation_id` / `automation_run_id` so operators can pivot into the canonical runtime directly
- **Outbound action producers now reuse one receipt path**:
  - Bug Monitor GitHub publish/recheck now falls back to directly discovered MCP tools when capability bindings lag, so read/write GitHub actions do not fail just because bindings are stale
  - repeated Bug Monitor publish calls now reuse the existing posted receipt instead of drifting into a second GitHub side effect
  - read-only Bug Monitor recheck no longer inherits the fail-closed posting gate, so inspection can proceed without pretending it is a write
- **Workflow board and debugger usability**:
  - moved the workflow board onto its own full-width row in the Run Debugger
  - made desktop workflow lanes horizontally scrollable with jump-to-active controls instead of clipping off-screen columns
  - surfaced offered/executed tools, workspace-inspection usage, web-research usage, and artifact-validation details directly in task inspection
  - added richer coding-task verification details in the Run Debugger, including per-step verification results and `done` status for successfully verified code tasks
  - failed automation runs now preserve the latest linked session id so the debugger can still link back to the most recent transcript context
  - workflow node outputs now expose typed stability metadata including `workflow_class`, `phase`, `failure_kind`, and artifact-candidate summaries so the debugger is driven by backend state instead of transcript inference
  - workflow runs now emit typed node-scoped lifecycle events such as `workflow_state_changed`, `artifact_accepted`, `artifact_rejected`, `research_coverage_failed`, and verification/repair events so stability state can be consumed from shared runtime history
  - desktop/TUI coder run summaries now include typed workflow stability fields and recent workflow events per task so the developer inspector follows the same backend contract as the control panel
  - Studio saved-workflow cards now surface the latest run’s typed stability snapshot so authoring views can see recent status, phase, and failure-kind state without leaving Studio
  - artifact finalization now scores verified output, session writes, and preexisting output so the strongest candidate wins deterministically instead of depending on late placeholder-phrase rejection
  - control-panel Studio and Run Debugger now consume shared workflow-stability selectors instead of duplicating node-output and lifecycle parsing per page
  - more control-panel workflow surfaces now use the shared workflow-stability selector layer for session IDs, latest stability snapshots, node-output text, and telemetry extraction
  - desktop agent-automation views now reuse the shared coder workflow-run parsers for session IDs and node outputs instead of duplicating local extraction logic
  - shared desktop coder workflow-run helpers now also normalize checkpoint and lifecycle-history access so agent-automation views stop hand-rolling those workflow records
  - shared desktop coder workflow-run helpers now also provide completed/pending/blocked node IDs plus gate and failure access so agent-automation diagnostics use one checkpoint contract
  - shared desktop coder detail views now also read gate state through the same workflow-run helper contract instead of reaching into checkpoint payloads directly
  - shared desktop coder workflow-run helpers now also provide usage metrics and summary text so agent-automation views can drop more local checkpoint/detail parsing
  - shared desktop coder workflow-run helpers now also own run display titles and failed-run recovery checks so agent-automation views stop duplicating that workflow logic
  - shared desktop coder workflow-run helpers now also provide status-label formatting so agent-automation views stop carrying their own run-status mapping
  - shared desktop coder workflow-run helpers now also provide node-output summaries and session-id extraction so agent-automation diagnostics stop hand-parsing output payloads
  - shared desktop coder workflow-run helpers now also provide stop-reason and node-attempt helpers so agent-automation views drop more direct run/checkpoint field access
  - shared desktop coder workflow-run helpers now also provide blocker extraction so desktop automation and coder detail views surface the same run issues
  - added initial canonical workflow smoke coverage in `tandem-server` HTTP integration tests for research, artifact, and coding workflow state contracts
  - shared desktop workflow-run helpers now also normalize lifecycle-derived recovery, failure-chain, promotion, and repair event slices so agent-automation views stop reimplementing workflow-event filtering
  - shared workflow-event summary helpers now normalize phase, failure-kind, and fallback reason rendering across the control-panel debugger and desktop developer inspector
  - shared control-panel workflow selectors now own completed, blocked, and pending node-id extraction so `AutomationsPage` stops hand-parsing checkpoint node arrays
  - shared control-panel workflow selectors now also own workflow task-state calculation plus completed/pending node counts so `AutomationsPage` drops more page-local checkpoint logic
  - shared control-panel workflow selectors now also own active-session counts so workflow headers stop reading session arrays directly
  - shared control-panel workflow selectors now also own node attempt counts and node-output session ids so the workflow board projection stops reading nested checkpoint fields directly
  - shared control-panel workflow selectors now also own checkpoint-based current-task selection so workflow focus stops being decided inside `AutomationsPage`
  - shared control-panel workflow selectors now also own the checkpoint-based workflow board projection so `AutomationsPage` no longer rebuilds task rows inline
  - shared control-panel workflow selectors now also own the first-pending-task fallback used by active workflow focus detection
  - shared control-panel workflow selectors now also own blocked-node counts so debugger headers and summary rows stop counting blocked arrays inline
  - control-panel workflow focus detection now prefers typed lifecycle node events from the shared workflow stability contract before falling back to transcript/session-text inference
  - control-panel task inspection now consumes pre-normalized recent workflow event summaries from the shared workflow stability layer instead of re-summarizing raw lifecycle entries inline
  - workflow run-history normalization for context events, blackboard patches, and persisted run events now lives in the shared workflow stability layer instead of `AutomationsPage`
  - workflow debugger telemetry seed normalization for persisted and context events now lives in the shared workflow stability layer instead of `AutomationsPage`
  - control-panel workflow event accessors for run ids, event types, timestamps, and reason text now live in the shared workflow stability layer instead of `AutomationsPage`
  - control-panel live session/event log rows now use shared workflow session-event normalization instead of being shaped inline in `AutomationsPage`
  - event-derived workflow blocker classification now lives in the shared workflow stability layer instead of `AutomationsPage`
  - control-panel workflow telemetry rows now use shared workflow event display normalization instead of formatting raw event payloads inline
  - control-panel workflow task inspection now consumes a shared normalized artifact/research/verification detail object instead of deriving those fields through long page-local `useMemo` chains
  - the Automations Tasks tab now reads workflow runs from a canonical `/automations/v2/runs` all-runs API instead of first depending on saved workflow-definition IDs, so mirrored workflow runs still appear even when they are not discovered through the saved-definition list
  - blocked workflow runs are now surfaced as task issues in the Tasks tab instead of being silently excluded from the failed-run bucket
  - fixed an `AutomationsPage` render regression where stale `eventType`/`eventReason`/`eventAt` references crashed the Tasks tab at runtime and left the page appearing empty and non-interactive
  - fixed a second `AutomationsPage` render regression where a stale `buildWorkflowProjectionFromRunSnapshot` reference crashed opening historical workflow tasks/runs
- **Workflow Studio model configuration**:
  - replaced free-text workflow model inputs with provider-backed selectors
  - added an optional shared-model mode so one provider/model choice can be applied across every workflow agent for cheaper runs
- **Automation execution now prefers deterministic file-backed workflow behavior**:
  - `automation_v2` nodes now run with explicit required tool sets instead of relying on the generic auto-router alone
  - normalized workflow tool exposure so `read` implies `glob` for workspace discovery
  - built-in `websearch` now supports backend selection via `TANDEM_SEARCH_BACKEND`, with Tandem-hosted routing plus direct `brave`, `exa`, and self-hosted `searxng` overrides instead of an Exa-only path
  - official Linux setup now writes search defaults into `/etc/tandem/engine.env`, including `TANDEM_SEARCH_BACKEND=tandem`, `TANDEM_SEARCH_URL`, and optional direct-provider override keys for later operator use
  - web-research failures now degrade more cleanly when the configured backend is unavailable, so research workflows can continue local-only instead of looping on unavailable search calls
  - added prewrite requirements for workspace inspection and web research before file-finalization retries narrow down to write-only
  - write-required workflow retries now force the first missing artifact write instead of continuing to offer discovery tools before any declared output exists
  - coding workflow scheduling now filters overlapping write scopes out of the same runnable batch so parallel code tasks do not edit the same repo area at once by default

### Fixed

- **Storage memory regression fixes**:
  - removed snapshot creation from `append_message()` and `append_message_part()` to stop accumulating full session history copies during routine message and tool updates
  - snapshots are now only created on explicit `fork_session()` calls, preserving revert capability without memory overhead on every update
  - added atomic writes with temp-file + rename pattern to prevent data corruption from partial writes during flush
- **Strict write recovery and replay fidelity**:
  - fixed streamed write-arg previews being dropped before session persistence, so malformed or partially streamed provider tool calls now retain recoverable args
  - fixed failed malformed write calls persisting empty `{}` args when normalized best-effort args were already available
  - fixed session-history merge behavior so stronger structured tool args replace weaker raw-string or partial-arg snapshots when later evidence arrives
  - fixed repo-aware session summaries and model-facing chat replay to preserve recovered tool args, errors, and write lineage instead of silently dropping malformed-write context
- **Canonical journal linkage and operator surfacing**:
  - fixed routine, legacy automation, and `automation_v2` operator routes so any returned `contextRunID` is immediately dereferenceable instead of being an eventually-consistent hint
  - routine/artifact operator routes now eagerly sync the canonical context-run blackboard before returning linkage to operators
  - coder operator and approval surfaces now consistently expose one preferred durable run reference instead of privileging transient worker session ids
- **Artifact integrity for file-backed workflows**:
  - fixed agents overwriting declared artifacts with placeholder status notes such as “completed previously” / “preserving file creation requirement”
  - fixed declared workflow artifacts being replaced by stray touch/status/marker files created by the model
  - fixed substantive blocked briefs being deleted just because the node was semantically blocked; blocked research now preserves useful artifact content for inspection
  - fixed fresh workflow runs wiping prior declared outputs before a replacement artifact existed; failed reruns now preserve the last substantive file instead of leaving the workspace empty
  - added recovery from in-session write history so earlier substantive file content can be restored when a later placeholder overwrite wins the final on-disk write
  - cleared stale descendant outputs on blocked-step continue/retry so subtree recovery no longer reuses bad artifacts
- **Workflow blocking and runtime semantics**:
  - fixed blocked node outcomes to stop downstream steps consistently instead of letting draft/review/publish continue with blocked handoff artifacts
  - fixed review nodes with `approved: false` to propagate a blocked status cleanly through the automation runtime and debugger
  - fixed file-backed research briefs being marked `completed` when they cited workspace sources without ever calling `read`; these now block even if the model writes a polished “source-backed” brief
  - fixed timed-out `websearch` attempts still counting as successful current-market research; research now blocks when required web research only timed out or returned no usable result
  - brief/research nodes now carry stricter prewrite requirements for concrete `read`, successful web research, one automatic repair retry, and coverage-aware validation metadata before they finalize as blocked
  - research artifact validation now records actual `read` paths, discovered relevant files, `Files reviewed` coverage backed by reads, unreviewed relevant files, web-research success, and repair-pass state so blocked runs show the real failure cause
  - code workflows with multi-step verification plans now emit explicit verification outcomes; partial verification blocks completion, failed verification emits `verify_failed`, and fully verified code tasks finish as `done`
  - fixed `/workspace/...` tool paths so file-backed workflow nodes resolve against the actual workspace root instead of failing on a fake alias
- **Saved Studio workflow deletion and restart persistence**:
  - fixed saved Studio workflows reappearing after engine restart by cascading automation deletion into persisted `automation_v2` run history so old run snapshots cannot recreate deleted workflows
- **Control-panel source-install docs**:
  - fixed the control-panel README examples so service commands work both from the repo root and from inside `packages/tandem-control-panel`
- **Channel and browser runtime defaults**:
  - channel-created sessions now pre-approve browser tools and `mcp*` tool namespaces so channel users do not get stuck on invisible approval prompts
  - browser sidecar env flags now use clap-friendly boolean strings and browser-open requests normalize blank profile ids instead of passing malformed values downstream
- **Permission matching for tool namespaces**:
  - fixed permission evaluation so wildcard permission names like `mcp*` match namespaced tool ids instead of only exact permission strings

## [0.4.7] - Released

### Added

- **Lossless cross-session channel memory archival**:
  - added automatic archival of completed Telegram/Discord/Slack user-visible exchanges into global retrieval memory while keeping full raw transcripts in ordinary session storage
  - added provenance-based dedupe for archived `chat_exchange` rows so repeated retries of the same exchange do not duplicate global memory indefinitely
  - added default memory-tool permissions for newly created channel sessions so channel bots can actually call `memory_search`, `memory_store`, and `memory_list`
- **Channel workflow-planning slash commands**:
  - added grouped `/help` output with topic help via `/help schedule`
  - added `/schedule plan`, `/schedule show`, `/schedule edit`, `/schedule reset`, and `/schedule apply` so channel users can draft and save automations without leaving Telegram/Discord/Slack
  - added workflow-planner workspace reuse so slash-command drafts inherit the active session workspace root when available
- **Expanded namespaced operator commands for channels**:
  - added `/automations`, `/runs`, `/memory`, `/workspace`, `/mcp`, `/packs`, and `/config` command families on top of existing engine APIs
  - added topic help via `/help automations`, `/help runs`, `/help memory`, `/help workspace`, `/help mcp`, `/help packs`, and `/help config`
  - added explicit `--yes` confirmation for destructive channel commands such as automation delete, memory delete, and pack uninstall
- **Storage-root standardization guidance and diagnostics**:
  - added startup diagnostics that warn operators when `TANDEM_STATE_DIR` and `TANDEM_MEMORY_DB_PATH` point at different roots
  - added focused regression coverage for canonical memory DB path resolution and channel archival dedupe behavior

### Changed

- **Standard install storage layout now converges on one Tandem root**:
  - shared path resolution now falls back to `TANDEM_STATE_DIR` before OS defaults, so standard installs keep memory, config, logs, and session storage under one canonical Tandem directory
  - control-panel setup helpers, VPS examples, and quickstart scripts no longer generate `TANDEM_MEMORY_DB_PATH` by default
  - standard OS defaults remain:
    - Linux: `~/.local/share/tandem/`
    - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/tandem/`
    - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\tandem\\`

### Fixed

- **Memory-tool reliability and retrieval correctness**:
  - fixed public memory tool calls being able to override the backing SQLite path via arbitrary `db_path` values
  - fixed `memory_list tier=global` decoding against `global_memory_chunks`, including the broken `token_count` / column-index path
  - fixed channel archival writing to a different SQLite file than the one used by `memory_search` and `memory_list`
  - fixed fresh channel sessions failing to access memory because memory tools were missing from the default permission allowlist

## [0.4.6] - Released

### Added

- **Advanced Swarm Builder across desktop and control panel**:
  - added a new mission-oriented advanced builder on top of `AutomationV2Spec` for coordinated multi-agent workloads
  - added authored mission blueprints with mission goal, shared context, orchestrator selection, workstreams, dependencies, output contracts, review stages, and approval gates
  - added first-class PM semantics for advanced missions, including phases, lanes, priorities, milestones, and gate metadata
  - added advanced-builder compile preview, validation warnings, graph summaries, and grouped lane/phase visualization
  - added native control-panel support for the advanced builder so web and desktop can both create and edit advanced mission automations
  - added in-product operator guidance for the web advanced builder, including a how-it-works modal, inline help text, and starter mission presets
  - added external starter-mission preset files so advanced builder examples live as content instead of hardcoded UI data
- **Desktop Coder workspace for coding-swarm creation and operations**:
  - turned the desktop `Developer` surface into `Coder` and made it the visible home for coding swarms
  - added a dedicated Coder workspace with `Create` and `Runs` tabs instead of a legacy run inspector-only screen
  - embedded coding-swarm creation in Coder on top of the existing advanced mission builder and `MissionBlueprint -> AutomationV2Spec` flow
  - added coding preset selection, user-repo context surfacing, and a lightweight saved-template shelf in the Coder create flow
  - added automation-backed Coder run projection so coder-tagged `AutomationV2` runs appear directly in the Coder run list
  - added operator tabs for coder runs covering overview, transcripts, context, artifacts, and memory
  - added direct cross-links from Coder runs into Agent Automation and Command Center

### Changed

- **Advanced mission execution, recovery, and observability**:
  - compiled advanced missions into richer `AutomationV2Spec` metadata while keeping execution on the existing automation runtime
  - added mission-wide inheritance so workstreams receive the global brief, success criteria, shared context, scoped assignment, dependency context, and output expectations
  - improved automation runtime scheduling with phase-open semantics, runnable frontier shaping, and priority-aware ordering without violating dependency legality
  - added advanced-automation reopen/edit continuity, including reconstruction of older sparse `mission_blueprint` records from compiled automation data
  - expanded control-panel graph preview and scope editing so per-step tools and MCP overrides are easier to inspect and edit
  - clarified Phase 6 preset/template status: advanced mission starter presets remain a local bundled shelf pending stronger persisted preset promotion, while agent-team templates already use workspace-backed persisted storage
- **Coder now reuses the existing mission and automation stack instead of acting as a separate coding surface**:
  - tagged coder-originated missions with typed coder metadata instead of inventing a second coding executor or run model
  - wired the desktop to consume explicit backend-linked context run IDs for automation-backed coder runs instead of synthesizing them locally
  - resolved user repo context from the active user project path, including repo root, remote slug, current branch, and default branch, and merged that context into coder mission metadata
  - extracted shared coder run list, run detail, and action toolbar components so the Coder workspace is not glued to full-page legacy surfaces

### Fixed

- **Automation V2 control, failure handling, and run diagnostics**:
  - added explicit operator-stop, guardrail-stop, pause, resume, and recovery semantics for advanced automation runs, including tighter active session and instance cleanup
  - hardened branch-local repair, gate rework, and pause/recovery flows so completed sibling branches remain intact and blocked fan-in is recomputed coherently
  - added structured node lifecycle events, repair history, milestone promotion history, and richer per-step diagnostics in automation run inspection
  - fixed advanced-builder schedule payloads to use the server-required tagged `misfire_policy` shape
  - fixed external mission preset loading in the control panel
  - fixed an engine panic caused by malformed one-character quoted scalar values during automation execution and converted node panics into normal run failures instead of leaving runs deceptively pending
  - fixed channel bots silently ignoring inbound messages when control-panel channel settings were saved with a blank `allowed_users` field; blank allowlists now normalize to wildcard `["*"]` in both the control panel and server runtime config
- **Coder workspace data and operator wiring**:
  - fixed the blank or underpowered desktop coder screen by routing it through a real creation-and-operations workspace
  - fixed automation-backed coder detail views to rely on explicit backend context-run linkage
  - fixed the local coder template flow to use an explicit editor instead of a prompt-only save action

## [0.4.5] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **Explicit workflow tool access controls in the control panel**:
  - added `All tools` vs `Custom allowlist` controls to the workflow creation wizard
  - added matching tool-access controls to the workflow automation edit modal
  - surfaced the selected tool policy in the wizard review step before deploy
  - wired workflow-plan apply to honor `tool_access_mode` and `tool_allowlist` through operator preferences

### Changed

- **Workflow automation editing and run-debug UX refinements**:
  - expanded the workflow edit modal into a large editor layout with a dedicated prompt-editing area for step objectives
  - made workflow provider/model selectors preserve saved values and use the panel’s styled selector treatment
  - improved the run debugger modal and workflow board sizing so the board can grow, the right rail no longer crops blocker/failure text, and lower log panels stop starving the board of height
  - tightened workflow prompt-editor cards by removing duplicated step text and redundant node-id badges
  - improved workflow review-step readability by collapsing long plan/prompt text into expandable markdown previews

### Fixed

- **Workflow automation schedule/tooling and publish reliability**:
  - fixed workflow automation save payloads to use the server-required tagged `misfire_policy` shape
  - fixed workflow agents defaulting to an overly narrow tool subset by making tool access explicit and configurable
  - fixed duplicate workflow-automation list rows in the control panel by normalizing rendered Automation V2 entries by id
  - corrected workflow debugger failure reporting for malformed shell tool calls and surfaced a clearer failure reason in the run debugger
  - hardened the engine loop so malformed tool calls such as `BASH_COMMAND_MISSING`, `WEBFETCH_URL_MISSING`, and missing file/write args get bounded inline self-repair retries before burning workflow node attempts
  - fixed `@frumu/tandem-client` publish builds by restoring missing `AgentStandupCompose*` type imports in the TypeScript client

## [0.4.4] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Official headless bootstrap path through `@frumu/tandem-panel`**:
  - added a real `tandem-setup` CLI with explicit `init`, `doctor`, `service`, `pair mobile`, and `run` commands
  - added shared bootstrap modules for canonical env-path resolution, env generation, engine-config bootstrapping, and install-time diagnostics
  - added cross-platform service generation for Linux `systemd` and macOS `launchd`
  - added a shared `service-runner` entrypoint so managed services use the same env loading and runtime startup contract on both platforms
  - added focused regression coverage for bootstrap env generation, `systemd` unit generation, `launchd` plist generation, and `doctor` output
- **Agent standups, reusable agent personalities, and workspace memory defaults**:
  - added reusable agent personalities in the control panel with persistent prompts, default models, and avatar upload
  - added server-side standup workflow composition on top of Automation V2 using saved agent personalities
  - added workspace-aware memory defaults so chats and automations can use `memory_search`, `memory_store`, and `memory_list` without manually supplying `session_id` or `project_id`
  - added deterministic `project_id` binding for workspace-backed sessions to improve recall across prior conversations in the same workspace
  - updated standup workflows to combine memory recall with workspace inspection through `glob`, `grep`, and `read`

### Changed

- **Control-panel bootstrap and runtime wiring**:
  - made `tandem-setup init` the documented bootstrap path while keeping legacy `tandem-control-panel --init` compatibility
  - updated control-panel bootstrap to prefer canonical OS config/data locations for official installs instead of cwd-only `.env` ownership
  - added `TANDEM_CONTROL_PANEL_HOST`, `TANDEM_CONTROL_PANEL_PUBLIC_URL`, and canonical control-panel state-dir handling for future gateway/mobile pairing work
  - updated the control-panel runtime to bind explicitly to the configured panel host and to load managed env files before startup
  - updated package/docs/example guidance to point headless installs at the control-panel gateway layer instead of the old quickstart bootstrap path

### Fixed

- **Automation V2 save verification after storage migration**:
  - fixed workflow-plan apply and control-panel automation saves failing with `WORKFLOW_PLAN_APPLY_FAILED` when stale legacy `automations_v2.json` files were still present alongside the canonical data file
  - kept strict persistence verification on the active canonical automation file while downgrading mismatched legacy fallback files to warnings instead of rejecting the save
  - added a regression test covering successful automation save/apply with a stale legacy `automations_v2.json` migration artifact present

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed

- **Automation V2 restart persistence and state-path hardening**:
  - fixed an engine startup race where the Automation V2 scheduler could persist an empty in-memory map before saved automations were loaded, wiping `automations_v2.json` on restart
  - moved Automation V2 canonical persistence into the Tandem global `data/` directory and kept legacy root-level files as migration fallback during load
  - added persistence verification, startup/load diagnostics, and recovery from run snapshots when automation definitions are missing but run history still exists

### Added

- **Tandem TUI coding-agent workflow UX**:
  - added coding-focused shortcuts:
    - `Alt+P` opens workspace file search and inserts `@path` references into the active composer
    - `Alt+D` opens a scrollable git diff overlay for quick workspace-change review
    - `Alt+E` opens the active composer content in `$VISUAL` / `$EDITOR` and returns edited text back into the TUI
  - added matching slash commands:
    - `/files [query]`
    - `/diff`
    - `/edit`
  - added modal infrastructure for coding workflows:
    - file-search modal with keyboard navigation/confirm
    - pager overlay with up/down/page scrolling
  - improved tool-call/tool-result transcript rendering into multi-line execution cells for better readability during coding runs
  - updated Tandem TUI docs and help content to surface the new coding workflow shortcuts and commands

- **Desktop orchestrator and command-center stability improvements**:
  - fixed orchestrator resume behavior so paused/failed runs with no planned tasks trigger planning (`start`) instead of attempting to execute an empty plan
  - improved run listing compatibility by merging engine context runs with legacy local orchestrator runs, preventing sessions from disappearing in mixed-storage scenarios
  - improved run deletion for engine context runs by removing shared `data/context_runs/<run_id>` state and surfacing real filesystem errors instead of silently ignoring failed deletes
  - replaced native desktop confirm popups in orchestrator flow with in-app confirmation dialogs for `Start Fresh Run` and resume model-switch actions
  - added in-app toast handling for provider quota/payment failures so users see actionable `payment required` / credit-limit errors in the UI
  - updated planner guidance to avoid over-collapsing non-trivial report/objective requests into a single task, restoring multi-task decomposition behavior
  - reduced `tool.lifecycle.start` log spam by suppressing duplicate in-flight `ToolStart` events for the same logical tool call even when providers stream arg updates
  - fixed command center run action visibility to rely on selected run identity directly, preventing cases where a selected running run looked stuck with no available controls
  - fixed validator/retry mismatch where write-intended tasks classified as `Research`/`Inspection`/`Validation` could bypass strict-write enforcement and loop into `Max retries exceeded` with `no changed-file evidence`; retries now auto-escalate to strict-write when validator feedback proves no workspace changes

- **Initial Tandem Coder engine API foundation**:
  - added engine-owned coder workflow runtime control through:
    - `GET /coder/status`
  - hardened coder memory promotion rules for newer memory kinds:
    - `duplicate_linkage` now requires both linked issue and linked pull-request numbers before promotion
    - `regression_signal` now requires structured regression entries plus supporting review/summary evidence
    - generic terminal `run_outcome` backfills can no longer be promoted without workflow evidence artifacts
  - broadened duplicate-linkage memory beyond PR submit so PR review and merge follow-on runs now persist their own issue↔PR linkage candidates from parent issue-fix runs
  - broadened post-failure regression learning beyond Bug Monitor by writing `regression_signal` candidates when issue-triage reproduction fails
  - issue-fix validation failures now also emit `regression_signal` memory with failed validation evidence
  - issue-fix worker-session failures now also emit rich `run_outcome` memory instead of relying only on generic terminal backfill
  - triage, review, and merge worker-session failures now also fail runs truthfully and emit rich `run_outcome` memory with worker artifact/session context
  - issue-fix retrieval now prioritizes `regression_signal` memory so failed validation history can influence later fixes across related issues
    - `GET /coder/projects/{project_id}`
    - `GET /coder/projects/{project_id}/runs`
    - `POST /coder/projects/{project_id}/runs`
    - `GET /coder/projects/{project_id}/bindings`
    - `PUT /coder/projects/{project_id}/bindings`
    - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/execute-next`
  - `GET /coder/status` now summarizes total runs, active/awaiting-approval counts, workflow distribution, run-status distribution, project count, and the latest coder run directly from engine-owned run state
  - added `GET /coder/projects`, which summarizes known repo bindings, workflow coverage, latest run metadata, and project-level coder policy from existing engine-owned run state
  - added `GET /coder/projects/{project_id}`, which returns project policy, explicit binding, and recent run state in one engine-backed payload
  - added `GET /coder/projects/{project_id}/runs`, which returns project-scoped coder runs with execution policy and merge policy summaries already attached
  - added `POST /coder/projects/{project_id}/runs`, which creates coder runs from a saved project binding and fails closed with `CODER_PROJECT_BINDING_REQUIRED` when that binding has not been configured
  - added an explicit shared coder memory retrieval helper and surfaced its `retrieval_policy` on run detail and `GET /coder/runs/{id}/memory-hits`, so workflow-specific ranking is now part of the engine contract instead of an implicit triage-only implementation detail
  - `issue_triage` retrieval now prioritizes `regression_signal` alongside `failure_pattern`, and promoted triage reproduction failures can now be reused across related issues through governed memory because regression-signal promotion accepts reproduction and validation evidence artifacts in addition to summary/review artifacts
  - `issue_triage` can now infer duplicate pull-request candidates from historical `duplicate_linkage` memory and writes its own `duplicate_linkage` candidate when triage concludes an issue is already covered by linked PR history
  - triage/fix retrieval now gives `duplicate_linkage` more weight, so cross-workflow issue↔PR history surfaces ahead of more generic triage memory when linked duplicates exist
  - `pr_review` now reuses prior `merge_recommendation_memory` on the same PR, and `merge_recommendation` now reuses prior `review_memory` on the same PR, so adjacent workflow context is available through the shared retrieval layer instead of depending only on governed-memory fallback
  - real issue-fix PR submit now writes `duplicate_linkage` memory that links issue and pull-request numbers, returns that candidate in submit responses/events/artifacts, and makes it reusable in follow-on PR review retrieval
  - generic terminal coder transitions now backfill a reusable `run_outcome` candidate for failed and cancelled runs when no richer workflow-specific outcome already exists, and return that generated candidate directly from the transition response
  - Bug Monitor triage summaries now also persist governed `regression_signal` memory alongside `failure_pattern`, with a matching context-run artifact and structured expected-behavior context for later post-failure reuse
  - explicit project bindings can now be stored independently of runs, and `/coder/projects` now prefers those saved bindings over derived run bindings when both exist
  - merge-ready `merge_recommendation` runs now stop in `awaiting_approval`, emit `coder.approval.required`, and complete cleanly on `/coder/runs/{id}/approve` instead of bouncing back into `running`
  - approving a merge-ready recommendation now also writes an engine-owned `coder_merge_execution_request` artifact and emits `coder.merge.recommended`, so the post-approval merge handoff is explicit even before a real GitHub merge capability is wired
  - added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/merge-submit` with fail-closed `github.merge_pull_request` readiness, a persisted `coder_merge_submission` artifact, and a real MCP-backed merge path for approved merge recommendations
  - `merge-submit` now also fails closed on the approved handoff artifact itself, blocking execution unless the latest `coder_merge_execution_request` still says `recommendation = merge` with no remaining blockers, checks, or approvals
  - `merge-submit` now defaults to `submit_mode = manual` and rejects `submit_mode = auto` unless the follow-on run origin policy explicitly opted into auto merge execution
  - `merge-submit` now also requires an approving sibling `pr_review` for issue-fix follow-on merge runs, so a completed review with blockers or requested changes can no longer be used to push a merge through
  - `merge-submit` now evaluates the latest completed sibling `pr_review`, so a newer review with requested changes overrides an older approval instead of whichever review record happens to be discovered first
  - merge-ready recommendation approvals and merge run reads now expose a dynamic `merge_submit_policy` summary, so clients can see manual vs auto merge-submit eligibility before attempting the merge call
  - `coder_merge_execution_request` artifacts and `coder.merge.recommended` events now also carry a `merge_submit_policy_preview`, so streaming and artifact-driven clients get the same merge-submit policy context without a follow-up read
  - `merge-submit` now requires the merge run itself to be an auto-spawned follow-on before `submit_mode = auto` is eligible, so a manual follow-on merge run cannot escalate into auto merge execution even if the parent PR submit opted into auto merge recommendation
  - `merge_submit_policy` summaries now also include `preferred_submit_mode`, so clients and future automation can consume an engine-owned recommendation instead of inferring manual-vs-auto behavior from blocked flags alone
  - `merge_submit_policy` summaries now also make the current execution contract explicit with `explicit_submit_required = true` and `auto_execute_after_approval = false`, so clients know approval alone never auto-merges today
  - `merge_submit_policy` summaries now also include `auto_execute_eligible` and `auto_execute_block_reason`, so clients can distinguish “auto is preferred later” from “auto can run now” without reverse-engineering that from other flags
  - added `GET /coder/projects/{project_id}/policy` and `PUT /coder/projects/{project_id}/policy`, with a default-off project-level `auto_merge_enabled` switch that now feeds `merge_submit_policy.auto_execute_policy_enabled` and changes merge-ready auto-execution blocking to `project_auto_merge_policy_disabled` until a project explicitly opts in
  - `merge_submit_policy.auto_execute_eligible` now becomes `true` when a merge run is auto-spawned, review-approved, merge-ready, and the project-level `auto_merge_enabled` switch is on, while still keeping `explicit_submit_required = true` and `auto_execute_after_approval = false` so the engine tells the truth about readiness without auto-merging yet
  - `POST /coder/runs` now also returns `merge_submit_policy` for merge-recommendation runs, so manual and spawned merge follow-on creation responses surface project auto-merge policy and merge-submit prerequisites immediately instead of forcing a follow-up run read
  - `merge_submit_policy.auto_execute_block_reason` now reports the earliest real blocker (`requires_merge_execution_request`, `requires_completed_pr_review_follow_on`, `requires_approved_pr_review_follow_on`, etc.) instead of collapsing those states back to a generic `preferred_submit_mode_manual`
  - PR-submit `follow_on_runs` templates now also carry `merge_submit_policy_preview` for merge follow-ons, so clients can see project auto-merge policy and merge-submit prerequisites before the merge run even exists
  - merge-ready `coder.approval.required` events and `merge-recommendation-summary` responses now also carry `merge_submit_policy`, so streaming clients can see merge-submit readiness and project auto-merge policy without fetching the run
    - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/execute-all`
  - added structured intermediate and final artifacts for triage inspection/reproduction, issue-fix validation and patch evidence, PR review evidence, and merge readiness
  - added governed-memory-aware retrieval and reusable coder memory outputs across `issue_triage`, `issue_fix`, `pr_review`, and `merge_recommendation`
  - added engine-owned issue-fix PR drafting and approval-gated submit handoff through:
    - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-draft`
    - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-submit`
  - normalized PR-submit artifacts now preserve stable repo context and a canonical `submitted_github_ref`, and PR-result parsing now accepts minimal number-only GitHub/MCP result shapes so later review and merge flows have a stable PR handoff target
  - fixed PR submit MCP tool resolution so builtin raw tool names and runtime namespaced tool names both resolve correctly, and added a real HTTP-backed MCP regression that exercises non-dry-run PR submission end to end
  - added server-side follow-on run creation at `POST /coder/runs/{id}/follow-on-run`, so a successful issue-fix PR submission can spawn `pr_review` or `merge_recommendation` runs from the canonical submitted PR ref without frontend-owned handoff logic
  - PR submit artifacts now also carry machine-readable `follow_on_runs` templates so later review/merge workflows can be chained from the engine-owned submission payload without reconstructing run inputs in the UI
  - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-submit` now also returns `submitted_github_ref`, `pull_request`, and `follow_on_runs` directly in the API response so clients do not need a second artifact read to continue the workflow
  - `coder.pr.submitted` events now include the canonical submitted PR ref, PR number, and follow-on workflow templates so streaming clients can continue the workflow without a follow-up fetch
  - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-submit` can now optionally auto-create follow-on `pr_review` and `merge_recommendation` runs through engine-owned chaining, returning those spawned runs directly in `spawned_follow_on_runs`
  - auto-follow-on merge chaining now normalizes through review first, so requesting `merge_recommendation` auto-spawn implicitly schedules `pr_review` ahead of merge instead of trusting the client to order those runs correctly
  - merge auto-follow-ons are now explicit opt-in at submit time: requesting merge auto-spawn without `allow_auto_merge_recommendation` only auto-spawns `pr_review`, records the skipped merge follow-on with a machine-readable reason, and includes both spawned and skipped follow-on lists in the submission artifact and `coder.pr.submitted` event payload
  - spawned and manual follow-on coder runs now persist explicit `parent_coder_run_id`, `origin`, and `origin_artifact_type` metadata so review and merge runs can be traced back to the issue-fix PR submission that created them
  - `pr_review` now uses the real coder worker-session bridge during `review_pull_request`, persists `coder_pr_review_worker_session`, and feeds the parsed worker output into the existing review-evidence and final summary artifact flow instead of synthesizing review text inline
  - `merge_recommendation` now uses the real coder worker-session bridge during `assess_merge_readiness`, persists `coder_merge_recommendation_worker_session`, and feeds parsed worker output into the existing readiness and final summary artifact flow instead of hardcoded merge guidance
  - `issue_triage` now uses the real coder worker-session bridge during repo inspection, persists `coder_issue_triage_worker_session`, and reuses parsed worker output for inspection, reproduction, and final summary artifacts instead of synthetic triage step payloads
  - follow-on review and merge runs now persist structured `origin_policy` metadata so downstream runs know whether they were manual vs auto-spawned and whether merge auto-spawn had been explicitly opted in at submit time
  - PR-submit `follow_on_runs` templates now carry the same parent/origin policy context that spawned review and merge runs use, so clients can preview engine chaining policy before creating any downstream runs
  - follow-on run `origin_policy` now consistently uses `merge_auto_spawn_opted_in` for both templates and spawned/manual runs, avoiding two names for the same merge auto-spawn decision
  - merge-recommendation follow-on runs created from PR submission are now execution-gated until a sibling `pr_review` run completes, so merge assessment cannot run ahead of review even when the follow-on run already exists
  - PR-submit follow-on templates and merge follow-on run metadata now expose `required_completed_workflow_modes`, so clients can surface the review-before-merge prerequisite without inferring policy locally
  - `GET /coder/runs` and `GET /coder/runs/{id}` now return engine-owned `execution_policy` summaries for coder runs, so clients can tell when a merge follow-on is blocked by review policy before attempting execution
  - PR-submit handoff payloads now also expose follow-on `execution_policy_preview` metadata and live `execution_policy` on spawned follow-on runs, so clients can render review-before-merge gating directly from the submit response, artifact, and event payloads without an extra run fetch
  - `POST /coder/runs` now also returns `execution_policy`, so manual follow-on creation responses are immediately truthful about blocked merge-recommendation runs without requiring a follow-up read
  - blocked `execute-next` / `execute-all` responses now also return `coder_run`, `run`, and `execution_policy`, so clients can stay in sync after a policy block without issuing a second fetch
  - blocked `execute-next` / `execute-all` now also emit `coder.run.phase_changed` with `event_type = execution_policy_blocked`, so streaming clients can react to follow-on policy blocks without polling
  - merge-recommendation summaries that come back `merge` with no remaining blockers/checks/approvals now stop in `awaiting_approval` and emit `coder.approval.required`, instead of looking fully completed before an operator approves the recommendation

- **Bug Monitor settings foundation and server config/status surface**:
  - added persisted bug-monitor config and status state in `tandem-server`, including repo, MCP server, provider preference, and dedicated `model_policy.default_model` routing for the reporter agent
  - added fail-closed readiness validation for the selected provider/model, required GitHub capabilities, and selected MCP server connectivity
  - fixed the control-panel Bug Monitor tab initialization crash caused by early query access
  - changed reporter model selection from a strict catalog-only dropdown to typed model entry with provider suggestions so manual model IDs persist across reloads
  - generalized GitHub MCP capability readiness so arbitrary MCP server instance names can satisfy reporter issue capabilities instead of depending on hardcoded provider-style server names
  - added new HTTP endpoints for reporter configuration and operator visibility:
    - `GET /config/bug-monitor`
    - `PATCH /config/bug-monitor`
    - `GET /bug-monitor/status`
    - `GET /bug-monitor/drafts`
    - `GET /bug-monitor/drafts/{id}`
  - control-panel Settings now includes a dedicated `Bug Monitor` tab with:
    - enable/disable toggle
    - target repo configuration
    - reuse of existing MCP server connections
    - dedicated provider/model selection for a cheap/fast reporter route
    - readiness, capability coverage, and draft summary cards
  - added a direct `#/bug-monitor` control-panel route as the canonical Settings entry for Bug Monitor
  - desktop Settings now includes an engine-backed `Bug Monitor` surface with:
    - repo, MCP server, provider, and model route configuration
    - runtime readiness and capability visibility
    - recent draft visibility
    - deep-link into `Extensions -> MCP`
  - added a Tauri bridge for Bug Monitor config, status, draft listing, draft lookup, and manual report submission
  - fixed the desktop sidecar Bug Monitor config path to use the engine’s canonical `GET/PATCH /config/bug-monitor` route instead of a non-existent `/bug-monitor/config` path
  - added `POST /bug-monitor/report` so desktop and future clients can submit structured failure context through the engine and receive a deduped local draft record
  - desktop logs and failed orchestrator runs can now create Bug Monitor drafts directly without implementing issue logic in the frontend
  - added engine-owned Bug Monitor draft approval endpoints:
    - `POST /bug-monitor/drafts/{id}/approve`
    - `POST /bug-monitor/drafts/{id}/deny`
  - desktop Settings can now approve or deny `approval_required` Bug Monitor drafts directly from the recent-drafts list
  - control-panel Settings now uses the same engine draft approval endpoints so Bug Monitor draft decisions work consistently across both UIs
  - added engine-backed triage-run creation for approved Bug Monitor drafts through:
    - `POST /bug-monitor/drafts/{id}/triage-run`
  - triage-run creation now seeds a minimal `bug_monitor_triage` context run with inspection and validation blackboard tasks, plus draft-to-run dedupe through `triage_run_id`
  - desktop and control-panel Settings can now promote approved Bug Monitor drafts into triage context runs without frontend-owned run orchestration
  - control-panel Dashboard context-run visibility now includes `bug_monitor_triage` runs in the existing context-run drawer so the handoff can be inspected without a new page
  - added `POST /bug-monitor/drafts/{id}/issue-draft`, which renders a template-aware Bug Monitor issue draft artifact from the repo bug template before GitHub publish
  - Bug Monitor GitHub publish now uses that rendered issue-draft artifact instead of dumping raw `draft.detail` into new issues
  - auto-publish now defers with `triage_pending` until a triage-backed issue draft exists, preventing premature low-signal issue creation
  - fixed Bug Monitor incident persistence so draft-creation failures record a visible incident error instead of leaving a half-created incident with no draft or explanation
  - approving a Bug Monitor draft no longer fails the operator action just because the follow-up GitHub publish step is blocked
  - split Bug Monitor readiness into local ingest vs GitHub publish readiness so live tracker surfaces can report “watching locally” instead of incorrectly showing the monitor as fully blocked
  - added `POST /bug-monitor/drafts/{id}/triage-summary` so Bug Monitor triage can write a structured summary artifact with `what_happened`, `expected_behavior`, `steps_to_reproduce`, `environment`, and `logs`
  - Bug Monitor issue-draft generation now prefers that structured triage summary artifact over raw incident detail when rendering the repo issue template
  - Bug Monitor now suppresses duplicate incidents earlier in both runtime ingest and manual `POST /bug-monitor/report` flows by consulting stored `failure_pattern` memory before opening a fresh draft
  - Bug Monitor incidents now persist a compact duplicate summary when suppression happens so tracker UIs can explain duplicate suppression after reload/reconnect without overloading the raw source-event payload
  - Bug Monitor triage summaries now persist governed `failure_pattern` memory for subject `bug_monitor`, so structured triage can suppress later matching reports even without a prior coder-run artifact
  - Approving a Bug Monitor draft without triage now also persists governed `failure_pattern` memory from the approved draft itself, so operator-approved issues still teach duplicate suppression
  - `failure_pattern` memory now carries recurrence metadata and stronger issue-linkage metadata, and duplicate ranking uses recurrence as a tie-breaker after exact fingerprint matches
  - duplicate-suppressed Bug Monitor incidents now persist a normalized `duplicate_summary` envelope with match count, best-match details, recurrence metadata, and linked-issue unions so tracker UIs can explain suppression deterministically after reload/reconnect
  - manual `POST /bug-monitor/report` suppression now returns that same normalized `duplicate_summary` envelope, and failure-pattern matching reuses the exact-fingerprint -> recurrence -> score ordering so the reported best match stays aligned with runtime suppression
  - Bug Monitor failure-pattern reuse responses now attach the same normalized `duplicate_summary` envelope alongside any raw `duplicate_matches`, and coder-originated duplicate matches now emit a stable `match_reason` so exact-fingerprint priority survives through shared ranking and summary shaping

- **Initial Tandem Coder engine API foundation**:
  - added a first engine-owned coder API surface:
    - `POST /coder/runs`
    - `GET /coder/runs`
    - `GET /coder/runs/{id}`
    - `GET /coder/runs/{id}/artifacts`
    - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/execute-next`
  - coder runs are persisted as thin metadata records linked to engine context runs instead of a frontend-owned workflow store
  - `POST /coder/runs` now creates a linked `coder_issue_triage` context run for `issue_triage` workflows and seeds the first deterministic task template:
    - normalize issue reference
    - retrieve prior memory
    - inspect repo
    - attempt reproduction
    - write triage artifact
  - added initial `coder.run.created` event emission so clients can observe coder run creation through the engine event bus
  - `issue_triage` now has a first real worker bridge: `execute-next` claims the next runnable context task through the shared lease/claim runtime and dispatches deterministic inspection, reproduction, and final summary actions so the run can complete end to end without frontend-owned orchestration
  - `issue_fix` now uses that same `execute-next` worker bridge: the engine claims fix tasks through the shared task runtime, advances inspection and preparation nodes through workflow progression, and dispatches validation plus final summary handlers to complete the run end to end
  - `pr_review` now also uses `execute-next`: the engine claims review tasks through the same task runtime, advances the initial inspection node through workflow progression, and dispatches review-evidence plus final summary handlers to complete the run end to end
  - `merge_recommendation` now uses `execute-next` too: the engine claims merge-readiness tasks through the same task runtime, advances the initial inspection node through workflow progression, and dispatches readiness plus final recommendation handlers to complete the run end to end
  - added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/execute-all`, which loops that same engine-owned task runtime until a coder run completes, fails, cancels, exhausts runnable tasks, or hits a configured step cap
  - added backend regression coverage for coder run creation, retrieval, list projection, context-run linkage, and artifact projection
  - added the first fail-closed readiness gate for `issue_triage` coder runs:
    - required GitHub issue capability bindings must exist
    - explicitly requested MCP servers must be configured and connected
  - added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/memory-candidates` so `issue_triage` runs can persist engine-owned memory candidate payloads with blackboard artifact provenance
  - memory candidate writes now emit `coder.memory.candidate_added` and attach `coder_memory_candidate` artifacts to the linked context run
  - new `issue_triage` runs now seed their retrieval task with prior repo/issue memory candidate hints from earlier coder runs
  - added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/triage-summary` so the engine can write a concrete `triage.summary.json` artifact and attach it as `coder_triage_summary`
  - added `GET /coder/runs/{id}/memory-hits` so clients can inspect ranked triage retrieval hits for the current coder run
  - `issue_triage` bootstrap now combines prior `coder_memory_candidate` payloads with project semantic memory search and writes a `coder_memory_hits` artifact into the linked context run
  - triage summary writes now auto-generate reusable `triage_memory` and `run_outcome` memory candidates so later coder runs can reuse structured triage conclusions without a second manual write step
  - `issue_triage` memory retrieval now also ranks governed/shared memory hits from the existing engine memory database alongside project semantic memory and prior coder-local candidates
  - added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/memory-candidates/{candidate_id}/promote` so reviewed coder memory candidates can be stored in the governed memory database and optionally marked shared when reviewer and approval metadata are supplied
  - added thin coder control endpoints:
    - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/approve`
    - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/cancel`
  - coder control endpoints now replay the existing context-run `plan_approved` and `run_cancelled` transitions instead of introducing a second coder lifecycle model
  - added `coder.run.phase_changed` emission for coder approve/cancel transitions and fixed cancelled coder runs to project a dedicated `cancelled` phase
  - coder `issue_triage` readiness now reuses the shared engine capability-readiness evaluator, so run creation blocks on the same missing/unbound/disconnected/auth-pending conditions exposed by `/capabilities/readiness`
  - explicit `mcp_servers` requested by coder runs remain hard requirements on top of that shared readiness check
  - the HTTP test harness now seeds a connected GitHub MCP server/tool cache so coder tests exercise the real readiness/discovery path rather than a reduced fallback
  - unified coder memory promotion with the generic governed-memory contract: the coder adapter now reuses the shared `memory_put` / `memory_promote` implementation path instead of writing directly to the global memory database
  - factored run-scoped governed-memory capability issuance into shared helpers in `skills_memory.rs`, so coder workflows now derive their subject and tier policy through the same helper path as the generic memory routes instead of hand-building a parallel token shape
  - fixed cold-start global memory initialization so `/memory/*` routes create the memory DB parent directory before opening SQLite, which also keeps the shared governed-memory path reliable for coder promotion
  - normalized coder event payloads so `coder.run.created`, `coder.run.phase_changed`, `coder.artifact.added`, `coder.memory.candidate_added`, and `coder.memory.promoted` now share the same base run metadata and artifact events carry explicit `kind` context for consumers
  - added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-review-summary` so `pr_review` runs can write a structured `coder_pr_review_summary` artifact and emit a first `run_outcome` memory candidate
  - added a first `pr_review` coder workflow skeleton on top of context runs, including fail-closed GitHub pull-request readiness checks, seeded PR review tasks, and direct MCP GitHub capability bindings for pull-request list/get/comment actions
  - `pr_review` now defaults to pull-request-specific memory queries, bootstraps a `coder_memory_hits` artifact at run creation, and reuses prior review `run_outcome` memory during later reviews of the same repo/PR
  - `pr_review` summary writes now also emit reusable `review_memory` candidates, and follow-on PR reviews can retrieve that review-specific memory through the shared coder memory-hits path
  - `pr_review` summary writes now also emit `regression_signal` candidates when review input includes historical regression signals, and later PR reviews can retrieve those signals through the same repo/PR memory-hits path
  - added the first `merge_recommendation` coder workflow skeleton with PR-backed readiness checks, seeded merge-assessment tasks, bootstrapped `coder_memory_hits`, and `POST /coder/runs/{id}/merge-recommendation-summary` for structured merge recommendation artifacts
  - merge recommendation summaries now emit reusable `merge_recommendation_memory` and `run_outcome` candidates so later runs can reuse prior merge guidance without needing a separate manual candidate write
  - added a dedicated `merge_recommendation_memory` candidate kind so merge guidance is stored as reusable recommendation knowledge instead of only a generic run outcome
  - added the first `issue_fix` coder workflow skeleton with issue-backed readiness checks, seeded fix and validation tasks, bootstrapped `coder_memory_hits`, and `POST /coder/runs/{id}/issue-fix-summary` for structured fix summary artifacts with reusable `run_outcome` memory
  - `issue_fix` summary writes now also emit reusable `fix_pattern` memory so later fix runs can reuse prior patch strategies and validation context
  - `issue_fix` memory retrieval now ranks same-issue `fix_pattern` and issue-fix `run_outcome` hits ahead of generic triage memory so fix runs surface prior patch strategy first
  - `merge_recommendation` memory retrieval now ranks same-PR `merge_recommendation_memory`, merge run outcomes, and regression signals ahead of generic review memory so merge runs surface prior merge guidance first
  - `merge_recommendation` ranking now also prefers policy-rich same-PR memories that carry blockers, required checks, or required approvals over generic merge summaries, so readiness-specific history surfaces first
  - `pr_review` memory retrieval now ranks same-PR `review_memory`, `regression_signal`, and PR review outcomes ahead of generic triage memory so review runs surface prior review guidance first
  - `pr_review` ranking now also prefers richer same-PR review memories that carry blockers, requested changes, or regression signals over generic review summaries, so actionable review history surfaces first
  - `issue_triage` memory retrieval now ranks same-issue `failure_pattern`, triage-memory, and triage run outcomes ahead of generic hits so duplicate/root-cause history surfaces first during new triage runs
  - `issue_fix` summary writes now also emit a dedicated `coder_validation_report` artifact when validation steps or results are provided, so validation evidence is consumable without parsing the fix summary
  - `issue_fix` summary writes now also emit reusable `validation_memory` candidates, and same-issue fix retrieval ranks that validation-specific memory ahead of generic triage memory so later fix runs can reuse prior validation evidence directly
  - `issue_fix` now starts using a real coder-owned worker session during `prepare_fix`: the engine resolves a worker model, creates a scoped session in the repo workspace, runs a real prompt through `run_prompt_async_with_context`, and persists the worker transcript as a `coder_issue_fix_worker_session` artifact before validation continues
  - `prepare_fix` now also derives a deterministic `coder_issue_fix_plan` artifact from the worker transcript, so downstream validation and final summary steps reuse a stable fix-plan record instead of dropping the worker output on the floor
  - `validate_fix` now also launches a real coder-owned validation session and persists a `coder_issue_fix_validation_session` artifact, so validation evidence is coming from the same engine session/runtime path instead of a synthetic placeholder step
  - `prepare_fix` now also harvests concrete changed-file evidence from worker tool invocations and persists it as `coder_changed_file_evidence`, giving later fix validation and UI surfaces an engine-owned record of touched paths when the worker actually edits files
  - changed-file evidence now captures per-file tool provenance plus short content previews when worker tool args include editable payloads, and final `coder_patch_summary` artifacts now carry those harvested entries forward for downstream review surfaces
  - `issue_fix` patch evidence now also snapshots the touched workspace files from the engine side, attaching lightweight file-existence, size, line-count, and preview metadata to both `coder_changed_file_evidence` and `coder_patch_summary`
  - final issue-fix summaries now also emit a dedicated `coder_patch_summary` artifact that ties the structured fix summary to changed files plus the linked worker and validation session IDs, giving desktop and future UIs a stable engine-owned patch-summary surface before full diff harvesting is added
  - added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-draft` for `issue_fix`, which builds an engine-owned `coder_pr_draft` artifact from the latest fix summary, validation, and patch evidence and emits `coder.approval.required` for human review before submission
  - added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-submit`, which reuses that `coder_pr_draft`, enforces fail-closed `github.create_pull_request` readiness, and writes a `coder_pr_submission` artifact for dry-run or approved submission flows
  - `issue_fix` validation and final summary generation now reuse those worker-session, validation-session, and issue-fix-plan artifacts, attaching session IDs, transcript excerpts, and plan-derived fields instead of relying only on generic inline placeholders
  - fixed a small set of ownership bugs in `skills_memory.rs` that were blocking `tandem-server` validation for the shared governed-memory path used by coder promotion and worker-backed issue-fix execution
  - `issue_triage` memory retrieval now ranks same-issue `failure_pattern`, `triage_memory`, and issue-triage `run_outcome` hits above generic project/governed matches so triage runs surface prior failure signatures and conclusions first
  - repo-scoped coder memory retrieval is now GitHub-ref-aware, so `pr_review` and `merge_recommendation` get a true same-PR boost instead of only issue-number or recency bias
  - promoted coder memory now stores richer searchable governed-memory content from workflow payloads, including fix strategy, root cause, blockers, required checks, approvals, validation details, and regression summaries instead of only a bare summary string
  - merge recommendation summaries now also write a dedicated `coder_merge_readiness_report` artifact whenever blockers, required checks, or required approvals are present so merge readiness state can be consumed directly without reparsing the summary artifact

- **Setup-understanding across channels and chat surfaces**:
  - added a shared deterministic setup-intent resolver at `POST /setup/understand` in `tandem-server`
  - setup understanding now classifies provider setup, MCP/integration setup, automation creation, channel setup help, broad setup help, and normal pass-through chat
  - resolver scoring now uses explicit setup/workflow language, provider/model and integration entity matches, MCP catalog presence, and current state gaps such as missing providers or disconnected integrations
  - added backend regression coverage for provider setup interception, integration interception, automation interception, clarification of broad setup requests, and normal-chat pass-through

- **Channel setup interception and scoped clarification**:
  - `tandem-channels` now calls the shared setup-understanding endpoint before normal prompt routing
  - clear automation setup requests in Telegram, Discord, and Slack now launch Pack Builder preview directly instead of relying on the brittle pack-intent matcher alone
  - provider and integration setup requests in channels now return deterministic setup guidance instead of spending a full LLM turn on ordinary chat
  - ambiguous setup requests now create a scoped pending clarifier so the next reply resolves within the same channel conversation/thread/topic
  - existing slash commands and Pack Builder confirm/cancel reply handling remain the highest-priority deterministic paths

- **Desktop and control-panel chat setup cards**:
  - desktop chat now preflights outgoing messages through setup understanding and renders setup cards that route users into Settings, MCP/Extensions, or Pack Builder preview
  - control-panel chat now performs the same setup preflight and surfaces setup cards that route users into Settings, MCP, or Automations
  - added a Tauri sidecar bridge for setup understanding so desktop chat uses the same backend interpretation contract as channels and the control panel

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- **Scoped channel sessions and trigger-aware channel routing foundations**:
  - `tandem-channels` now attaches structured trigger metadata (`direct_message`, `mention`, `reply_to_bot`, `ambient`) and stable conversation scope metadata (`direct`, `room`, `thread`, `topic`) to incoming channel messages
  - channel session identity now scopes by conversation, not just sender, so the same user no longer shares one active session across unrelated Discord channels/threads, Slack threads, and Telegram private/topic contexts
  - dispatcher slash-command/session resolution now uses the scoped conversation key and migrates legacy `{channel}:{sender}` channel-session records forward on first access
  - Slack now supports `mention_only` end-to-end across runtime env config, persisted server config, and `/channels/config`
  - adapter normalization/gating was tightened so Telegram, Discord, and Slack all make mention-only decisions from explicit trigger context rather than adapter-local string stripping
  - added regression coverage for scoped key generation, legacy session-map migration, Slack mention normalization, and channel config surface behavior

- **Strict swarm write recovery and engine-client retry hardening**:
  - fixed OpenAI/OpenRouter streamed tool-call parsing so multi-chunk write args keep the real tool-call ID and no longer drop follow-up argument deltas when later chunks omit the tool name
  - hardened write-arg recovery in the engine loop so truncated/malformed JSON can still recover `content` even when `path` is absent, and raised the default provider output budget from `2048` to `16384` to avoid clipping large single-file artifacts
  - session/tool history persistence now keeps write args/results intact across engine events by using a dedicated session-part channel, coalescing repeated tool invocation updates, and persisting `tool_result` args for verifier/session consumers
  - swarm planner/worker prompts now prefer single-pass implementation for single-file objectives instead of over-decomposing greenfield artifact creation into fragile inspect/refine task chains
  - added consistent local-engine retry handling across control panel, Tauri desktop, and TUI clients for transient transport failures and `ENGINE_STARTING` startup responses

- **Orchestration planner/runtime diagnostics hardened**:
  - strict swarm planning now surfaces upstream provider failures directly in orchestration start instead of collapsing them into `LLM planner returned no valid tasks`
  - backend session dispatch now persists explicit assistant-visible engine error markers such as `ENGINE_ERROR: AUTHENTICATION_ERROR: ...` so planner/session consumers can show the real provider failure reason
  - control-panel planner detection now recognizes provider quota/auth failures (for example OpenRouter `403 Key limit exceeded`) and reports them clearly when LLM planning is required
  - session tool-history persistence now recognizes the real runtime `WireMessagePart` shape used by backend tool invocation/result events, fixing false `NO_TOOL_ACTIVITY_NO_WORKSPACE_CHANGE` swarm task failures when tools actually ran
  - added regression coverage for runtime-shaped tool-part persistence in session history so verifier/session snapshots stay aligned with backend execution

- **Provider catalog honesty in Settings and `/provider`**:
  - `GET /provider` now returns explicit provider catalog metadata (`catalog_source`, `catalog_status`, `catalog_message`) so clients can distinguish live remote catalogs from config-defined or unavailable catalogs
  - removed synthetic single-model fallback catalog entries for built-in providers from the provider catalog response
  - provider catalog discovery now attempts live remote model lists for supported providers (`openrouter`, `openai`, `groq`, `mistral`, `together`, `anthropic`, `cohere`) and reports manual-entry states for providers without reliable generic discovery
  - remote provider model discovery now reads runtime-auth and persisted provider auth stores in addition to config/env values, so authenticated catalogs can load honestly in Settings without forcing API keys into config files
  - control-panel Settings now labels provider catalogs accurately:
    - real remote counts for live catalogs
    - `configured models` for config-defined catalogs
    - `manual entry` for providers without live model discovery
  - unsupported/non-generic providers remain configurable in Settings without being misrepresented as one-model catalogs
  - added backend regression coverage for empty/manual providers and config-sourced provider catalogs

- **Declarative workflow runtime, APIs, and pack extensions**:
  - added a new `tandem-workflows` workspace crate for workflow schema definitions, YAML loading, source merge rules, and validation
  - added engine-owned workflow runtime execution, hook dispatch, simulation, run persistence, and event streaming in `tandem-server`
  - added workflow HTTP APIs:
    - `GET /workflows`
    - `GET /workflows/{id}`
    - `POST /workflows/validate`
    - `POST /workflows/simulate`
    - `POST /workflows/{id}/run`
    - `GET /workflows/runs`
    - `GET /workflows/runs/{id}`
    - `GET /workflow-hooks`
    - `PATCH /workflow-hooks/{id}`
    - `GET /workflows/events`
  - pack inspection now surfaces declared workflow entrypoints, workflow files, and workflow hooks as first-class pack metadata and risk/permission-sheet signals
  - added workflow runtime coverage for manual runs, hook dispatch/dedupe behavior, context-run blackboard projection, and provider/catalog-backed route handling

- **Control-panel visual system and workflow operations refresh**:
  - introduced a shared `tandem-theme-contract` package plus a richer control-panel theme system with curated theme metadata, CSS variables, and a dedicated theme picker surface
  - added reusable animated UI primitives and refreshed page shells/cards/layouts across dashboard, orchestrator, packs, chat, feed, settings, and login flows
  - packs/workflows operations now have a dedicated control-panel workflow lab for pack inspection, workflow runs, hook toggles, event simulation, and live workflow event streaming
  - orchestration/swarm server routes now track per-run controller state more explicitly for status, revision requests, and run switching instead of relying on a single global active-run snapshot

- **Headless-first Chromium browser automation with readiness diagnostics**:
  - added a new `tandem-browser` Rust sidecar crate for local Chromium automation over stdio with typed browser RPC methods (`browser.open`, `browser.navigate`, `browser.snapshot`, `browser.click`, `browser.type`, `browser.press`, `browser.wait`, `browser.extract`, `browser.screenshot`, `browser.close`)
  - added browser readiness and install diagnostics with real launch smoke tests, distro-aware Linux install hints, and sidecar/browser detection for headless VPS hosts and desktops
  - added engine-managed sidecar install and discovery:
    - `tandem-engine browser install`
    - `POST /browser/install`
    - managed sidecar resolution from Tandem shared `binaries/` storage so normal installs do not require `TANDEM_BROWSER_SIDECAR`
    - release packaging/upload for standalone `tandem-browser-*` GitHub release assets
  - added browser runtime config and env support:
    - `browser.enabled`
    - `browser.sidecar_path`
    - `browser.executable_path`
    - `browser.headless_default`
    - `browser.allow_no_sandbox`
    - `browser.user_data_root`
    - `browser.max_sessions`
    - `browser.default_viewport`
    - `browser.allowed_hosts`
    - `TANDEM_BROWSER_SIDECAR`
    - `TANDEM_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE`
    - `TANDEM_BROWSER_HEADLESS`
    - `TANDEM_BROWSER_ALLOW_NO_SANDBOX`
    - `TANDEM_BROWSER_USER_DATA_ROOT`
    - `TANDEM_BROWSER_ALLOWED_HOSTS`
  - added typed engine browser tools:
    - `browser_status`
    - `browser_open`
    - `browser_navigate`
    - `browser_snapshot`
    - `browser_click`
    - `browser_type`
    - `browser_press`
    - `browser_wait`
    - `browser_extract`
    - `browser_screenshot`
    - `browser_close`
  - browser tools now register in both server mode and one-shot runtime mode; `browser_status` remains available even when browser execution is not runnable
  - added browser status surfaces across engine and clients:
    - `GET /browser/status`
    - browser summary block on `GET /global/health`
    - `tandem-engine browser status`
    - `tandem-engine browser doctor`
    - `POST /browser/smoke-test`
    - `tandem-browser doctor --json`
    - `tandem-browser serve --stdio`
    - TUI `/browser status` and `/browser doctor`
    - control-panel Browser Diagnostics settings card with install + smoke-test actions
  - browser artifacts now persist screenshots and large extracts as files/artifacts instead of returning large base64 payloads to the model
  - browser navigation/action flows now reuse host-allowlist policy and external-integration gating, and explicit session cancel/dispose paths now clean up tracked browser sessions
  - browser smoke testing now supports an engine-owned `example.com` validation flow that opens, snapshots, extracts visible text, and closes through the live sidecar path
  - browser sidecar transport failures now preserve stderr context and retry once after a dropped stdio connection before surfacing an error to clients

- **Orchestrator multi-run event fan-in and run registry (engine + control panel)**:
  - tandem-engine now exposes multiplex context-run SSE fan-in via `GET /context/runs/events/stream`, supporting one stream for many run IDs with cursor resume support.
  - context-run stream payloads now include a normalized envelope (run-scoped event metadata + cursor state) for deterministic client reconciliation.
  - control panel adds `/api/orchestrator/events` routing that prefers engine multiplex SSE and falls back to legacy per-run bridging when needed.
  - control panel adds `/api/orchestrator/events/health` for live stream health checks (mode, run count, cursor, and fallback status).
  - orchestration UI now uses a run registry store so multiple active/completed runs can coexist in one workspace instead of single-run overwrite behavior.
  - new dedicated Orchestrator page flow starts in prompt/workspace mode, then supports run switching and resume across existing runs.
  - orchestration and chat session history affordances now use a shared history icon treatment for consistency.

- **Blackboard promoted as run coordination backbone (engine + control panel)**:
  - extended context blackboard state with first-class task rows (`tasks`) including workflow/lineage fields, lease metadata, retries, and optimistic `task_rev`
  - added task patch ops to append-only blackboard log:
    - `add_task`
    - `update_task_lease`
    - `update_task_state`
  - added simplified task coordination endpoints:
    - `POST /context/runs/{run_id}/tasks`
    - `POST /context/runs/{run_id}/tasks/claim`
    - `POST /context/runs/{run_id}/tasks/{task_id}/transition`
    - `GET /context/runs/{run_id}/blackboard/patches`
  - added Pack Builder -> blackboard bridge via optional `context_run_id` on:
    - `POST /pack-builder/preview`
    - `POST /pack-builder/apply`
    - `POST /pack-builder/cancel`
    - `GET /pack-builder/pending`
  - when `context_run_id` is provided, pack-builder lifecycle updates are materialized as blackboard task patches/events in that context run
  - added automation v2 DAG projection into blackboard tasks:
    - `POST /automations/v2/{id}/run_now`, `GET /automations/v2/{id}/runs`, and `GET /automations/v2/runs/{run_id}` now sync node status into context blackboard tasks
    - `GET /automations/v2/runs/{run_id}` now returns `contextRunID` for the derived context-run projection
  - added skill-router blackboard mapping via optional `context_run_id` on:
    - `POST /skills/router/match`
    - `POST /skills/compile`
  - skill-router routing/compile outcomes now materialize as blackboard tasks/events in the target context run
  - desktop convergence step:
    - Tauri `orchestrator_get_blackboard` now prefers engine `/context/runs/{run_id}/blackboard` and only falls back to local orchestrator store for legacy compatibility
    - Tauri `orchestrator_get_blackboard_patches` now prefers engine `/context/runs/{run_id}/blackboard/patches` with legacy local fallback during migration
    - legacy Tauri read commands (`orchestrator_get_events`, `orchestrator_list_runs`, `orchestrator_load_run`) now prefer engine context-run APIs first, with local store fallback only for legacy runs
  - control-panel swarm SSE parity:
    - `/api/swarm/events` now streams both context run events and incremental blackboard patch events (`kind: "blackboard_patch"`) so UI refresh remains live even when only blackboard state changes
  - control-panel swarm task board overflow hardening:
    - long task/prompt titles are now clamped with explicit `More/Less` expansion and forced wrapping
    - prevents single oversized task prompts from stretching/swallowing the board layout
  - task lifecycle now emits run events (`context.task.created`, `context.task.claimed`, `context.task.started`, `context.task.completed`, `context.task.failed`, etc.) with `patch_seq` and `task_rev` for UI projections
  - validated backward compatibility for legacy persisted blackboards (payloads without `tasks` now deserialize with safe defaults)
  - replay/drift responses now include blackboard task parity checks (revision/count/status) and replay-vs-persisted blackboard payloads for debugging
  - control panel swarm route now forwards blackboard patch streams (`blackboardPatches`) and blackboard-aware task state
  - control panel `SwarmPage` now ships blackboard panel modes:
    - docked view
    - expanded view
    - fullscreen debug view
  - new control panel blackboard views include run status/current step/why-next-step context, decision lineage, agent lanes, workflow progress, artifact lineage, drift alerts, and patch feed
  - added regression tests for:
    - single-winner concurrent claims
    - `command_id` idempotency
    - optimistic `task_rev` mismatch handling
    - monotonic patch sequence and dedupe behavior
    - replay compatibility with task blackboard state

- **Run Engine commit boundary for context-run mutations**:
  - added `ContextRunEngine` as the single mutation path for context runs, with per-run locking and deterministic commit ordering for event append, snapshot persistence, and compatibility blackboard projection writes
  - task mutation endpoints now commit through the run engine instead of performing split writes directly:
    - `POST /context/runs/{run_id}/tasks`
    - `POST /context/runs/{run_id}/tasks/claim`
    - `POST /context/runs/{run_id}/tasks/{task_id}/transition`
    - `POST /context/runs/{run_id}/events`
  - authoritative run events now carry stable mutation metadata including `event_seq`, `revision`, `task_id`, and `command_id`
  - `events.jsonl` is now treated as the authoritative ordered per-run mutation history, while `run_state.json`, `blackboard.json`, and `blackboard_patches.jsonl` remain derived compatibility outputs
  - read paths now repair stale snapshots from `events.jsonl` and stale blackboard projections from `blackboard_patches.jsonl`, reducing crash-consistency drift
  - `POST /context/runs/{run_id}/events` now rejects `context.task.*` writes so task authority cannot bypass the run engine
  - added regression coverage for task race single-winner claims, task event metadata, snapshot repair, blackboard repair, command idempotency, and concurrent multi-run isolation

- **Automation creation UX simplified (control panel)**:
  - replaced the fragmented `Agents`, `Packs`, and `Teams` pages with a unified `Automations` hub (`AutomationsPage.tsx`)
  - added a 4-step wizard: **What?** (plain-English goal) → **When?** (visual schedule presets + custom cron) → **How?** (execution mode selector) → **Review & Deploy**
  - execution mode selector offers **Single Agent**, **Agent Team** (recommended default), and **Swarm** — guides users toward orchestration instead of single-agent loops
  - **My Automations** tab consolidates installed packs, scheduled routines, and recent run history in one view with run-now actions
  - **Teams & Approvals** tab surfaces active agent team instances and pending spawn approvals
  - legacy routes (`#/agents`, `#/packs`, `#/teams`) auto-redirect to `/automations` for backward compatibility
  - primary sidebar navigation reduced from 12 to 7 items: **Dashboard, Chat, Automations, Swarm, Memory, Live Feed, Settings**
- **Pack Builder orchestration/swarm execution mode**:
  - `pack_builder` tool now accepts `execution_mode` (`"single"` | `"team"` | `"swarm"`) and `max_agents` (integer, 2–32) fields
  - execution mode and orchestration config are stored in the routine `args.orchestration` block so the runtime can dispatch to an agent team or parallel swarm instead of a single agent loop
  - default mode changed from `"standalone"` to `"team"` — orchestrated agent teams are now the default for new automations created via the chat/pack-builder flow
  - tool schema updated to document these fields with enum constraints

- **Pack Builder zip storage race condition fixed**:
  - generated pack zip files are now saved to a persistent state directory (`~/.tandem/data/pack_builder_zips/` or `TANDEM_STATE_DIR/pack_builder_zips/`) instead of `std::env::temp_dir()`
  - previously, OS-level temp-dir cleanup between `preview` and `apply` phases caused silent `preview_artifacts_missing` failures when an `apply` was submitted seconds or minutes later
  - `retain_recent_plans()` now performs best-effort cleanup of evicted plan staging directories to prevent accumulation of stale zip archives

- **Semantic tool retrieval for tool-schema context reduction**:
  - added embedding-backed tool retrieval in `ToolRegistry` (`retrieve(query, k)`) to avoid sending all tool schemas on every provider call
  - retrieval indexing now tracks runtime lifecycle events:
    - startup bulk indexing via `tools.index_all().await`
    - incremental indexing on `register_tool` (covers MCP tools connected after startup)
    - vector cleanup on `unregister_tool` and `unregister_by_prefix` (covers MCP disconnect/refresh paths)
  - engine loop now uses semantic retrieval candidates by default (`TANDEM_SEMANTIC_TOOL_RETRIEVAL=1`) with `TANDEM_SEMANTIC_TOOL_RETRIEVAL_K` defaulting to `24` (aligned to existing expanded tool cap)
  - explicit policy tools are unioned from the full tool list so request/agent/session allowlist matches are not dropped by top-K retrieval
  - runtime system prompt now includes a compact connected MCP integration catalog (server names only) gated by `TANDEM_MCP_CATALOG_IN_SYSTEM_PROMPT`
- **MCP-first Pack Builder workflow in engine**:
  - added built-in `pack_builder` tool with `preview`/`apply` phases for generating installable Tandem packs from plain-English goals
  - external capabilities now map to MCP catalog connectors by default, with explicit fallback warnings when no connector match is available
  - generated pack `missions/` and `agents/` now include explicit discovered MCP tool IDs instead of abstract connector instructions
  - preview output now includes candidate connector list (with docs/transport/auth metadata), selected MCP mapping, required secrets, and approval requirements
  - apply path now supports MCP registration/connect, tool sync, pack install, and paused-by-default routine registration (explicit enable approval required)
  - persisted generated pack presets under `presets/overrides/pack_presets/` including connector selections, registered servers, required credentials, and selected MCP tools
- **Pack Builder API-first parity workflow contract**:
  - added first-class endpoints:
    - `POST /pack-builder/preview`
    - `POST /pack-builder/apply`
    - `POST /pack-builder/cancel`
    - `GET /pack-builder/pending`
  - endpoints delegate to the same `pack_builder` implementation as `/tool/execute` to keep preview/apply/cancel semantics identical across invocation paths
  - added persisted workflow + prepared-plan stores (`pack_builder_workflows.json`, `pack_builder_plans.json`) for restart-safe pending state
  - added thread-scoped pending-plan resolution (`session_id + thread_key`) to prevent cross-thread confirmation/apply collisions
  - added new regression coverage for preview/pending/cancel endpoint roundtrip, thread-scoped apply behavior, and missing-secret apply blocking
- **Pack Builder activation and routing surfaces**:
  - added default `pack_builder` agent profile with MCP-first system prompt and restricted tool allowlist
  - added channel-dispatcher intent routing for “create/build automation pack” style requests to `pack_builder` with explicit tool allowlist
  - added API-first channel command mapping for pack-builder workflows:
    - preview is created via `/pack-builder/preview` (no provider round-trip)
    - `confirm`/`ok` -> `/pack-builder/apply` for pending plan on that channel thread
    - `cancel` -> `/pack-builder/cancel`
    - `use connectors: ...` -> `/pack-builder/apply` with connector override
- **Tauri Pack Builder parity bridge**:
  - added desktop command/sidecar wrappers for:
    - `pack_builder_preview`
    - `pack_builder_apply`
    - `pack_builder_cancel`
    - `pack_builder_pending`
  - added desktop chat inline Pack Builder cards with direct apply/cancel actions that call the same workflow endpoints (no assistant text parsing required)
  - added Tauri regression tests validating preview/apply/cancel/pending endpoint wiring
- **Pack Builder observability counters**:
  - emit `pack_builder.metric` events for:
    - `pack_builder.preview.count`
    - `pack_builder.apply.count`
    - `pack_builder.apply.success`
    - `pack_builder.apply.blocked_missing_secrets`
    - `pack_builder.apply.blocked_auth`
    - `pack_builder.apply.cancelled`
    - `pack_builder.apply.wrong_plan_prevented`
  - each metric event includes inferred `surface` tag (`web`, `tauri`, `telegram`, `discord`, `slack`, `unknown`) plus session/thread/plan context
- **Preset index compatibility expansion**:
  - extended server preset index contract with `pack_presets` collection
  - updated control panel packs view to consume `pack_presets` safely
  - updated TUI preset index response model and `/preset index` output to include `pack_presets`
- **Routine MCP tool-picker UX in control panel**:
  - routine builder now includes a connected-MCP tool browser with server filter + text search
  - users can add discovered MCP tools to routine allowlist with one click instead of manual comma-separated typing
  - picker is backed by runtime `mcp.listTools()` discovery and mirrors currently connected/enabled servers
- **Regression coverage for MCP connector usage**:
  - added HTTP test asserting external-goal pack previews produce MCP tool mappings and mission steps containing `action: mcp.*`
  - added apply-phase test asserting explicit approval gating
  - added preset-registry tests for indexing and override lifecycle of `pack_preset`
  - added channel router tests for pack-builder intent detection and default-route fallback

### Fixed

- **Swarm continue/resume execution no-op in control panel**:
  - fixed executor behavior so runs with an already `in_progress` step no longer exit early when `/context/runs/{run_id}/driver/next` returns no `selected_step_id`
  - executor now resumes the active `in_progress` step and drives it through `prompt_sync` instead of silently idling
  - `POST /api/swarm/continue` and `POST /api/swarm/resume` now return execution diagnostics (`started`, `requeued`, `selectedStepId`, `whyNextStep`) to make no-op conditions visible
  - surfaced swarm `lastError` inline in `SwarmPage` to expose provider/session failures immediately
  - execution session creation now falls back to configured swarm provider/model when older runs lack persisted `model_provider`/`model_id`
- **Swarm fail-closed execution + model resolution hardening**:
  - added deterministic execution-model resolution precedence for swarm steps: context-run model -> swarm state model -> engine default provider/model
  - swarm start now fails fast when no provider/model can be resolved, instead of creating no-model runs that silently dispatch no LLM calls
  - `prompt_sync` dispatch now fails closed in control-panel swarm executor when no assistant output is produced (empty/no-op response), with explicit `PROMPT_DISPATCH_EMPTY_RESPONSE` diagnostics
  - added loop guard that stops swarm execution when a step remains non-`done` after completion (`STEP_STATE_NOT_ADVANCING`) to avoid hidden infinite replays on stale step state
  - added engine-compat reconciliation path: when step completion events do not materialize `done` immediately, control panel now patches run step state to `done` via engine API and emits `step_completion_reconciled`
  - `/api/swarm/status` now surfaces resolved model source + executor state/reason for immediate diagnosis
- **Swarm run list cleanup controls**:
  - added user-scoped cleanup endpoints in control panel:
    - `POST /api/swarm/runs/hide`
    - `POST /api/swarm/runs/unhide`
    - `POST /api/swarm/runs/hide_completed`
  - hidden runs are persisted in `~/.tandem/control-panel/swarm-hidden-runs.json` and filtered from `/api/swarm/runs` by default
  - `SwarmPage` now supports per-run `Hide` and bulk `Hide Completed` actions for decluttering old test runs without destructive engine-side deletion
- **Swarm completion/output observability in control panel**:
  - fixed false error surfacing on successful completion: executor no longer writes `all steps are done` into `lastError` when a run legitimately completes
  - Swarm page now renders a dedicated `Run Output` panel with latest completed step, session ID, and assistant output preview
  - task cards now resolve `Open Session` from step completion events (`session_id`) so users can always inspect generated outputs
  - run/task status badges now use semantic colors (`completed/done` = success, `failed` = error, `in_progress` = warning)
- **Engine startup stability during pre-ready phase**:
  - background server tasks now wait for runtime readiness before accessing `AppState` runtime-backed fields
  - fixes startup panic `runtime accessed before startup completion` that could mark control-panel connectivity unhealthy on boot
- **Duplicate tool-call guard tuning for write/edit workflows**:
  - increased default duplicate-signature retry limit for `write`/`edit`/`multi_edit`/`apply_patch` tool calls from `3` to `200`
  - preserves strict guardrails for `pack_builder` (`1`) and shell tools (`2`)
  - keeps global override behavior via `TANDEM_TOOL_LOOP_DUPLICATE_SIGNATURE_LIMIT`
- **OpenAI-compatible MCP tool schema normalization**:
  - normalized nested MCP function schemas before provider dispatch so tuple-style `items` arrays and object nodes without `properties` are rewritten into OpenAI-valid function parameter schemas
  - fixes `TOOL_SCHEMA_INVALID` 400 failures such as `mcp_airtable_list_records_for_table` when using models like `openai/gpt-5.3-codex` through OpenRouter
- **Semantic retrieval reliability for action-heavy prompts**:
  - engine now falls back from semantic top-K tool candidates to the full tool list when prompts indicate web research or email delivery and required tool families are missing from retrieval output
  - provider call routing telemetry now emits retrieval fallback fields (`retrievalEnabled`, `retrievalK`, `fallbackToFullTools`, `fallbackReason`) to aid diagnosis
  - tool calls not offered in the current turn are now rejected deterministically with explicit available-tool hints instead of attempting execution against unavailable/guessed tool names
  - final response guard now blocks false “email sent” claims unless a successful email-like tool action was actually executed in the run
- **Pack Builder autonomous routine defaults**:
  - pack-builder apply now defaults to autonomous routine registration for unattended automation:
    - generated routines default to `status: active`
    - generated routines default to `requires_approval: false`
    - API apply route approval flags now default to `true` for connector registration, pack install, and routine enablement
  - pack-builder generated routine YAML now emits `requires_approval: false` and apply output reflects enabled-by-default routine behavior
- **Provider stream connect timeout resilience**:
  - default provider stream connect timeout increased from `30_000 ms` to `90_000 ms` to reduce false startup/connect failures for scheduled routines and slower providers
  - updated default env examples and quickstart setup scripts to `TANDEM_PROVIDER_STREAM_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS=90000`
- **Pack Builder permission friction across chat/channels**:
  - `pack_builder` tool is now allowed by default in baseline engine permission rules to prevent pack-creation requests timing out on first-use approval prompts
  - internal `pack_builder` apply-phase approvals remain required for connector registration, pack install, and routine enablement
- **Pack Builder retry-cost guardrail**:
  - duplicate-signature loop limit for `pack_builder` reduced to `1` to fail fast on repeated identical calls
  - added same-run duplicate-call guard for `pack_builder` to skip repeated execution attempts within one run cycle
- **Pack Builder UX + apply flow reliability**:
  - preview responses now return a concise human-readable summary (metadata remains structured JSON) instead of dumping raw/truncated JSON into chat output
  - fixed `connector_selection_required` to only trigger for unresolved external capabilities (built-in-satisfied external needs no longer force connector selection)
  - improved external email-action inference by detecting email-address targets in goals (even when the word “email” is absent)
  - apply flow now defaults connector registration to the plan-selected connectors (instead of an arbitrary single candidate)
  - safe previews now auto-apply by default (install pack + register routine paused) when no connector choice/secrets/manual setup are required
  - chat confirmation bridge: when a user replies with confirmation text after a Pack Builder preview, engine normalizes the next `pack_builder` call to `mode=apply` using the preview `plan_id` recovered from conversation context (prevents accidental new “confirm” packs across control panel, desktop, and channel threads)
  - pack-builder tool now also keeps last preview `plan_id` per session and interprets short confirmation goals (`ok`, `confirm`, `apply`, etc.) as apply of that session’s pending plan, so accidental `pack-builder-ok` installs are prevented even when model-side tool args are imperfect
  - apply output now renders explicit blocked summaries for:
    - `apply_blocked_missing_secrets`
    - `apply_blocked_auth`
  - cancelled plans are now terminal for later apply attempts (`plan_cancelled`)
  - control-panel chat now uses API-first pack-builder flow (preview/apply/cancel) for pack-intent and confirmation messages, reducing provider token burn and removing reliance on assistant paraphrase for state transitions
  - restored LLM-led initial pack creation flow (removed forced terminal short-circuit after `pack_builder` tool completion) so the assistant can continue in-chat guidance/questions when needed
  - control-panel chat now renders `pack_builder` state inline in the message thread (preview/apply cards with deterministic actions) instead of relying on side-rail-only visibility
  - channel dispatcher no longer short-circuits initial pack-intent messages into immediate preview text; deterministic `confirm`/`cancel` command mapping remains in place

  - engine startup now restores persisted provider keys into runtime provider config
  - `GET /provider/auth` now returns real per-provider auth status (`has_key`, `configured`, `source`)
  - `PUT /auth/{provider}` and `DELETE /auth/{provider}` now persist/remove provider keys for cross-restart behavior
- **Control panel provider wizard hardening**:
  - provider readiness now requires a stored key for key-based providers (non-`ollama`/`local`)
  - provider model tests now pin explicit provider/model and preflight for missing-key conditions
  - custom provider IDs are normalized consistently when saving/testing keys

### Fixed

- **Control panel packs runtime compatibility**: `Packs` view now falls back to direct engine endpoints when `state.client.packs`/`state.client.capabilities` namespaces are unavailable, preventing `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'list')` failures.
- **Settings tab UX**: Replaced generic button-like Settings section controls with dedicated tab styles (tab rail + active state) for clearer information hierarchy and better visual quality.
- **Settings container + icon hydration**: Settings tab content now renders inside the same Settings card container, and missing icon registrations (`package`, `sliders-horizontal`) were added so tab icons remain visible across section switches.
- **Control panel visual polish + theme parity**: Added shared theme-token application (`tandem.themeId`) and an Appearance selector in Settings so control panel visuals align with desktop themes, while upgrading shell controls/cards/nav/tabs to token-driven styling with smoother first-paint consistency.
- **Control panel first-load polish**: Replaced bare “Loading...” placeholders with themed skeleton surfaces and tokenized sidebar/brand chrome to reduce perceived jank during route/view switches.
- **Control panel icon coverage**: Expanded Lucide icon registration for packs/settings builders (`archive`, `copy-plus`, `sparkles`, `shield-check`, `arrow-up-circle`, `badge-check`, `binary`, `list`, `pencil`) to prevent missing icons after view/tab rerenders.
- **Settings tab icon persistence**: Fixed Settings subview icon hydration scope so top-level Settings tab icons no longer disappear when switching between `Packs/Channels/MCP/Files`.
- **Chat theme parity**: Refactored chat surface styles (sessions rail, message panes, composer, pills/chips, tool/approval/pack rails, upload progress, message pre blocks) to use shared theme tokens instead of hardcoded `zinc/slate` palettes so theme selection updates chat consistently.
- **Porcelain readability hardening**: Increased Porcelain text and border contrast and switched markdown rendering styles to token-based colors with light-theme overrides to prevent washed-out chat/content text.
- **Automations theme consistency**: Added `agents-theme` scoped token overrides for remaining `slate/zinc` utility islands in Automations/Wizard surfaces and converted agents tab/step chips to token-driven colors so Automations now follows theme selection.
- **Starter pack templates + personal tutorial**: Added three concrete importable starter templates under `examples/packs/` (`daily_github_pr_reviewer`, `slack_release_notes_writer`, `customer_support_drafter`) and a step-by-step personal walkthrough at `specs/packs/PERSONAL_TUTORIAL_FIRST_PACK.md`.
- **Settings icon hydration stability**: Added mutation-observer-backed icon rehydration in Settings so icons remain visible when switching tabs with async subview updates.
- **Automations tab style parity**: Updated `#/agents` section tabs to reuse the same underline tab styling and accessibility roles used in Settings.
- **Multi-theme selection restored**: Re-enabled full control-panel theme catalog (Web Control, Electric Blue, Emerald Night, Hello Bunny, Porcelain, Neon Riot) and restored Settings Appearance selector with quick theme swatches.
- **Provider test reliability**: Simplified Settings `Test Model Run` flow to a single async run path (removed sync+async double-run behavior), increased wait timeout, and clarified success messaging to prevent false “waiting” stalls with OpenRouter/default providers.
- **Provider test session isolation**: Provider test now runs in an internal non-workspace session (`/tmp/tandem-provider-test`) with internal title prefix, and chat session lists filter these internal sessions so users do not see provider-test artifacts.
- **Provider-key visibility mismatch in web control panel**: fixed false “No stored key detected” status caused by a stubbed auth-status route and non-durable auth writes.
- **Provider test ambiguity**: fixed settings “Test Model Run” paths that could execute with implicit defaults instead of the selected provider/model.

## [0.3.28] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Control panel MCP auth-mode UX**: Added MCP connection auth modes in web control panel (`auto`, `x-api-key`, `bearer`, `custom`, `none`) with Composio-aware auto-header behavior and inline auth-preview guidance.
- **Dashboard activity visuals**: Added control panel dashboard charts/summary cards for recent runs, status distribution, and automation/schedule activity to improve operator visibility.
- **Automations + Cost dashboard section**: Added a first-class dashboard block with token and estimated USD cost KPIs (`24h`/`7d`) plus top automation/routine cost breakdown rows.
- **Automations workspace IA refresh**: Refactored `#/agents` into tabbed `Automations` UX (`Overview`, `Routines`, `Automations`, `Templates`, `Runs & Approvals`) to reduce operator overload and improve task focus.
- **Walkthrough wizard for automation setup**: Added first-run + on-demand guided walkthrough for routine and advanced automation setup, with URL-deep-linkable tab/step state.
- **Persistent Automations V2 backend foundation**: Added additive `automations/v2` API surface with new persisted state files (`automations_v2.json`, `automation_v2_runs.json`), DAG run checkpoints, run-level controls, and SSE stream endpoint.
- **Per-agent model policy in V2 runs**: Added per-agent `model_policy` and runtime node-level model resolution so each agent can run different model tiers for cost/perf tuning.
- **Run-level token/cost accounting for automations**: Added token usage and estimated cost fields on routine/automation run records with provider-usage event aggregation and configurable rate via `TANDEM_TOKEN_COST_PER_1K_USD`.
- **Agent template write APIs**: Added `POST/PATCH/DELETE /agent-team/templates` so template selection and editing can be managed via API (not file-only).
- **SDK surface for V2 + template management**: TypeScript client now exposes `automationsV2` namespace and agent-team template create/update/delete methods.
- **Python SDK parity for V2 + template management**: Added `client.automations_v2` namespace and agent-team template create/update/delete methods in `tandem-client-py`.
- **Control panel Automation Builder V2 (first iteration)**: Added a new V2 builder in `agents` view with schedule setup, configurable agent count, per-agent model/skill/MCP/tool-policy inputs, DAG node editor, and create flow.
- **Automation preset packs (engineering + business)**: Added one-click V2 presets for `GitHub bug hunter`, `Code generation pipeline`, `Release notes + changelog`, plus marketing/productivity packs (`Marketing content engine`, `Sales lead outreach`, `Productivity: inbox to tasks`).
- **Guide docs V2 refresh (`guide/src`)**: Updated SDK + MCP automation docs to include `automations/v2`, per-agent model policy examples, and agent template CRUD examples for TypeScript/Python.

### Changed

- **Control panel login hero animation**: Replaced organic login animation with a uniform silicon-chip/data-flow motif for a cleaner and more consistent first-run visual style.
- **Chat session UX behavior**: “New chat” now auto-collapses the chat history sidebar to prioritize message composition space.
- **MCP error visibility in control panel**: MCP add/connect now reloads server state after failures and surfaces server `last_error` details directly in UI feedback.
- **Scheduler cron behavior**: Routine/automation scheduling now evaluates true cron expressions with timezone-aware next-fire computation and misfire planning.
- **Tool policy matching model**: Runtime allow/deny checks now support exact, wildcard, and prefix policies (`*`, `mcp.github.*`, `mcp.composio.*`) across session and capability gates.
- **Control panel V2 operations**: Added Automations V2 list/controls in `agents` view, including run-now, automation pause/resume, per-automation runs inspection, and run pause/resume/cancel actions.
- **Automation UX naming simplification**: Control panel copy now presents advanced automation flow tooling without exposing internal V2 labels to operators.
- **Control panel animation runtime**: Added lightweight `motion` animation library and panel transition animations for tabs/wizard interactions.
- **Control panel route transitions animation pass**: Extended motion-based transitions across routed views (`tcp-card`/list/nav-active) with reduced-motion awareness.

### Fixed

- **User-message render timing in chat**: Fixed delayed user message visibility; user messages now render optimistically at send-time instead of waiting for model response completion.
- **Tool activity rail population**: Fixed missing tool activity updates in control panel chat by broadening event parsing to include `session.tool_call`, `session.tool_result`, and message part tool event variants.
- **Approval queue stale-state cleanup**: Fixed stale/previous permission requests persisting in chat approvals rail; pending request filtering, one-time approval semantics (`once`), and refresh-on-session-change behavior now clear resolved approvals reliably.
- **Composio MCP stream response compatibility**: Fixed MCP runtime parsing for streamable/SSE JSON-RPC responses during remote discovery (`initialize` / `tools/list`), resolving `Invalid MCP JSON response: expected value at line 1 column 1` failures on Composio endpoints.
- **Routine hard-pause runtime semantics**: Pausing a `running` routine run now actively cancels tracked live session(s) and records cancelled session IDs in pause responses/events.
- **Swarm view route-stability fix**: Fixed Swarm page re-render race/leak where timer/SSE-triggered refreshes could leave Swarm content stuck after navigating to other views.
- **Control panel hash-query soft routing**: Fixed excessive full-shell re-renders on same-route hash/query changes (for example Automations tab/wizard clicks), reducing UI flash and stale render races.
- **Automation Builder model selection UX**: Per-agent provider/model fields now default from configured settings with provider/model dropdowns and explicit custom override inputs for clearer, lower-error setup.
- **Automation Builder custom model-provider fix**: Fixed agent-row controls so `Custom provider` and `Custom model` fields are editable/enabled when selected, and model options populate from selected/default provider.
- **Automation Builder policy field simplification**: Replaced ambiguous MCP/tool CSV inputs with connected-MCP selection and tool policy modes (`standard`, `read-only`, `custom`) while keeping advanced custom allow/deny override support.

### Added

- **Identity configuration API + SDK parity**: Added `GET/PATCH /config/identity` with a typed personality preset catalog (`balanced`, `concise`, `friendly`, `mentor`, `critical`) and TypeScript/Python client support via `client.identity.get()/patch()`.
- **Dynamic tool router in engine loop**: Added intent-aware tool routing (`chitchat`, `knowledge`, `workspace_read`, `workspace_write`, `shell_exec`, `web_lookup`, `memory_ops`, `mcp_explicit`) with deterministic subset selection and MCP tool gating by default.
- **Per-request routing controls in prompt API**: Added `SendMessageRequest.tool_mode`, `tool_allowlist`, and `context_mode` (`auto|none|required` and `auto|compact|full`) for explicit runtime routing/context control from clients.
- **Tool routing/config telemetry events**: Added `tool.routing.decision` and `context.profile.selected` runtime events to expose selected-tool counts, routing pass/mode, and context compaction profile.

### Changed

- **Control panel channel configuration UX**: Channels view now loads persisted channel config, pre-fills existing values, and supports editing Discord `mention_only`/`guild_id` and Slack `channel_id` directly from the web control panel.
- **Channel diagnostics visibility in control panel**: Channel cards now surface backend `last_error` status so connector failures are visible without log tailing.
- **Discord usage guidance in control panel**: Added inline Discord guidance clarifying Tandem command style (`@bot /help`) and that Discord application slash commands are not registered by this integration.
- **Desktop Connections parity with web control panel**: Tauri Settings now adds Discord verification flow and richer setup diagnostics directly in desktop Connections UI.
- **Desktop runtime behavior guidance**: Added explicit Settings copy that channel listeners only run while the desktop app is open and the computer is awake, with an always-on deployment pointer.
- **Routine policy UX simplification (control panel)**: Added one-click `Allow everything` policy mode in routine create/edit that maps to unrestricted tools, external integrations enabled, and no approval gate.
- **Routine approvals operability in control panel**: Added Approve/Deny actions for pending routine/automation runs directly in routine cards, automations list, recent runs, and run inspector.
- **Telegram channel style customization**: Added configurable Telegram style profiles (`default`, `compact`, `friendly`, `ops`) with control panel support and server config exposure.
- **Config identity schema + soft legacy migration**: Engine config now supports canonical identity/personality structure under `identity.*` while accepting legacy `bot_name`/`persona` patch payloads and normalizing them into canonical fields.
- **Runtime assistant identity/personality injection**: Server prompt-context hook now injects bot name + personality preset/custom guidance into provider messages, with per-agent overrides applied to primary/subagent roles and hidden utility agents kept neutral.
- **Portal/control-panel identity naming**: VPS portal and control panel now fetch identity config and render bot/portal/control-panel labels from configured aliases instead of fixed hardcoded branding.
- **Protocol/header branding compatibility**: OpenRouter `X-Title` now supports `AGENT_PROTOCOL_TITLE` (canonical) with `TANDEM_PROTOCOL_TITLE` compatibility fallback, and auth now accepts both `x-agent-token` and `x-tandem-token`.
- **Guide docs identity/auth refresh**: Updated `guide/src` docs for identity/personality configuration and SDK usage, and switched curl examples to canonical `X-Agent-Token` while documenting `X-Tandem-Token` compatibility.
- **Identity settings UI across frontends**: Added bot-name/personality settings editors in Desktop (Tauri) Settings and Control Panel Settings, including personality preset selection and custom instructions save flow through `/config/identity`.
- **Onboarding wizard identity step (desktop)**: Added a first-run setup shortcut to the new Identity section so bot name/personality can be configured during initial setup.
- **Identity-aware chat labels**: Control Panel chat and Desktop chat message/header labels now use configured bot identity names instead of fixed “Assistant” labels.
- **Custom bot avatars across surfaces**: Added `identity.bot.avatar_url` support plus avatar upload controls in Desktop and Control Panel settings, with avatar rendering in Desktop chat and portal/control-panel shell/chat identity surfaces.
- **Server-side avatar normalization**: Identity avatar uploads are now normalized in server patch flow (data URL decode, resize to bounded dimensions, PNG re-encode), allowing larger client uploads without persisting oversized raw images.
- **Engine tool-loop guard tuning**: Engine loop now supports `TANDEM_MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS` and `TANDEM_TOOL_LOOP_DUPLICATE_SIGNATURE_LIMIT` to reduce high-cost retry spirals on repeated tool signatures.
- **Default tool exposure behavior**: Engine `tool_mode=auto` now starts with a no-tools pass and escalates to a capped intent-matched subset only when needed, instead of publishing the full tool catalog on every call.
- **Context sizing behavior for trivial prompts**: Added compact context profile selection for short/simple prompts and server-side memory-injection skip heuristics for low-signal greetings/chitchat to reduce token overhead.
- **SDK prompt parity for routing controls**: TypeScript and Python session prompt clients now support passing routing options (`toolMode`/`toolAllowlist`/`contextMode`) to `prompt_async`.
- **Provider stream fail-safe behavior**: Engine provider streaming now enforces configurable connect/idle timeouts to fail stuck upstream calls deterministically and release active runs instead of hanging sessions.
- **Timeout defaults aligned across engine and installers**: Engine runtime defaults now use `TANDEM_PROMPT_CONTEXT_HOOK_TIMEOUT_MS=5000`, `TANDEM_PROVIDER_STREAM_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS=30000`, and `TANDEM_PROVIDER_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS=90000`; quickstart/VPS/control-panel installers now write these into default engine env files.
- **Shell tool timeout guardrail**: Added `bash` tool timeout support (`timeout_ms` arg and `TANDEM_BASH_TIMEOUT_MS`, default `30000`) so stalled shell commands cannot keep runs active indefinitely.
- **Control panel chat stream resiliency**: Chat stream watchdog now uses longer no-event/max-window thresholds and a run-settlement wait path before surfacing a stuck-run failure.

### Fixed

- **npm publish provenance metadata for control panel**: Added missing `repository` metadata in `packages/tandem-control-panel/package.json` so npm provenance validation accepts `@frumu/tandem-panel` CI publishes.
- **Discord allowlist identity matching**: Discord inbound authorization now supports user ID, username, global name, and mention-style identity entries (for example `@name`, `<@id>`, `<@!id>`) instead of ID-only matching.
- **Discord non-response misconfiguration path**: Fixed common “connected but not responding” states caused by hidden/default Discord settings by exposing mention-only and guild filters in the control panel.
- **Channel setup consistency across surfaces**: Added unified Discord verify backend (`POST /channels/{name}/verify`) and desktop integration so setup checks are consistent across web and Tauri flows.
- **Telegram MarkdownV2 heading readability**: Telegram formatter now renders markdown headings as styled heading text instead of leaking literal escaped `###` markers in bot replies.
- **Telegram MarkdownV2 chunk boundary robustness**: Message chunking now prefers safe markdown-entity boundaries to reduce formatting breakage and parse-mode failures when splitting long responses.
- **Runaway repeated tool-call retries**: Engine now guards duplicate non-read-only tool signatures (including repeated `bash` calls), emits deterministic loop-guard terminal messaging, and stops wasteful repeated provider/tool cycles.
- **Tool-context bloat on lightweight prompts**: Short/simple prompts no longer incur full tool list + memory context injection by default, reducing unnecessary token burn and repeated tool-call churn.
- **Startup-time runtime panic in prompt context hook**: Server prompt augmentation now fail-opens when runtime state is not yet installed, preventing `runtime accessed before startup completion` panics during startup races.
- **Cross-channel stuck-active runs**: Engine now times out stalled provider streams and returns terminal failure instead of leaving runs indefinitely active (which previously cascaded into session/run conflicts across web/Discord/Telegram).

## [0.3.26] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Engine storage file listing API**: Added `GET /global/storage/files` to enumerate files under the engine storage directory (`TANDEM_HOME`/`TANDEM_STATE_DIR`/resolved shared paths fallback), with `path` and `limit` query support.
- **Channel attachment local-ingest parity**: Discord and Slack adapters now download inbound attachments to local `channel_uploads` storage and populate attachment path metadata consistently with Telegram.
- **Provider multimodal message shape**: Added attachment-aware provider chat message model with image attachment support for OpenAI-compatible request payload construction.

### Changed

- **Channel -> engine prompt submission for attachments**: Channel dispatcher now sends uploaded attachments as explicit `file` message parts to `/session/{id}/prompt_async` instead of only text synthesis.
- **Attachment prompt guidance policy**: Channel synthesized prompts now direct models/tools to analyze supported attachment MIME types directly and report unsupported-format capability requirements explicitly.
- **OpenAI-compatible request building**: Provider stream path now emits multimodal `messages[].content` arrays when image attachments are present, while preserving text-only behavior when no attachments exist.
- **Engine runtime attachment routing**: Engine loop now maps inbound `MessagePartInput::File` image parts into provider attachments for first-iteration user context, including local-file-to-data-URL conversion with size caps.

### Fixed

- **“Image-capable model but image not analyzed” channel gap**: Attachments are now propagated end-to-end from channels through engine/provider dispatch instead of being reduced to metadata-only text markers.
- **Slack private attachment accessibility**: Slack file downloads now authenticate with bot bearer token for `url_private(_download)` resources before local persistence.
- **Directory traversal hardening on storage listing**: `/global/storage/files` rejects absolute and parent-directory path traversal segments in query path input.

## [0.3.25] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **MCP auth challenge extraction hardening**: Runtime now prefers structured auth fields from MCP payloads (for example `structuredContent.message` / `structuredContent.authorization_url`) before generic text blobs, improving challenge fidelity across providers like Arcade.
- **Quickstart UI preference persistence**: Added persistent storage for chat `Auto-allow all` approval mode so the toggle survives portal reloads/restarts.
- **Guard-budget diagnostics tests**: Added engine/runtime test coverage for per-run guard-budget classification and MCP auth message normalization/priority parsing.
- **Global memory persistence substrate (SQLite + FTS5)**: Added persistent global memory record storage in `memory.sqlite` (`memory_records` + `memory_records_fts`) with dedup indexes, FTS-backed search, and promote/demote/delete/list APIs over durable records.
- **Always-on memory ingestion events and pipeline**: Added server memory ingestor subscriber that captures memory candidates from run/tool/decision/auth event streams and emits canonical write lifecycle events:
  - `memory.write.attempted`
  - `memory.write.succeeded`
  - `memory.write.skipped`
- **Run-time memory observability events**: Added structured retrieval/injection telemetry emitted during provider planning:
  - `memory.search.performed` (scores, sources, latency)
  - `memory.context.injected` (count, token-size estimate)
- **Memory demotion API surface**: Added `POST /memory/demote` to move memories back to private/demoted state without hard delete.
- **SDK memory API parity updates (TS + Python)**: Updated both client SDKs for new memory payload shapes (`content`/`source_type`/`run_id`, promote/put response variants) and added explicit memory demote client methods.
- **Protocol contract alignment for global memory**: Updated HTTP/event contracts and OpenAPI summaries to include `/memory/demote`, global-memory route semantics, and memory lifecycle/search/injection SSE events.
- **Guide and SDK documentation refresh for global memory**: Updated root README (EN/zh-CN), SDK READMEs, and guide pages (`sdk/*`, headless endpoints, tools reference, engine command examples) to reflect always-on global memory semantics and demote support.

### Changed

- **MCP auth messaging output quality**: Sanitized/truncated auth-required messages emitted from runtime so user-facing chat responses avoid large escaped JSON or provider-internal instruction blobs.
- **Quickstart run lifecycle handling**: Before sending a new prompt, quickstart now best-effort cancels an existing active run (`cancelRun` / `cancel`) to avoid stale-run carryover behavior in active sessions.
- **Provider/tool compatibility normalization**: Hardened OpenAI-compatible tool publishing path with function-name sanitization, alias round-tripping, and function-parameter schema normalization for stricter provider validators.
- **Memory API backend behavior**: Server `/memory/*` routes now use durable global-memory DB records instead of in-process map state, preserving data across process restarts.
- **Memory retrieval timing model**: Retrieval/injection now runs in the engine planning loop (via server-installed prompt-context hook), so each provider iteration can pull fresh relevant memory rather than run-start-only context.
- **Prompt context assembly for planning loops**: Memory context is appended as bounded `<memory_context>` system material during provider planning iterations, with per-iteration scoring thresholds and observability.
- **Secret/PII safety on memory write path**: Added stronger write-path scrubbing/blocking before persistence (pattern-based redaction + hard-block markers), and redaction status/count metadata tracking on persisted records.

### Fixed

- **Runaway MCP/tool-call churn in a single run**: Engine loop now short-circuits additional MCP tool execution in auth-pending conditions and applies stricter fail-fast behavior when guard budget is exceeded to prevent high-cost retry spirals.
- **Misleading session-scoped budget fallback wording**: Guard-budget terminal behavior is now deterministic and explicitly run-scoped, reducing model-generated “session limit” confusion.
- **Model routing in quickstart sends**: Quickstart run submission path now consistently sends explicit provider/model overrides via `prompt_async`, aligning selected UI model with actual provider traffic.
- **OpenAI-compatible strict schema/tool-name 400s**: Fixed invalid tool-name and function-parameter schema edge cases that caused upstream `invalid_request_error` failures during MCP-heavy runs.
- **MCP auth loop UX degradation**: Reduced repeated noisy auth output and improved event/message behavior for `mcp.auth.required` / `mcp.auth.pending` flows across engine and web chat.

## [0.3.24] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **MCP auth diagnostics contract surfaced to clients**: Clarified and propagated runtime auth-required signaling via `mcp.auth.required`, including richer auth challenge metadata handling in engine/web chat paths.
- **MCP server auth/session state fields**: MCP server state now tracks auth/session continuity fields used by diagnostics and reconnect flows:
  - `last_auth_challenge`
  - `mcp_session_id`
- **Release workflow control for Python packages**: Added an independent PyPI publish toggle in registry publish workflow so Python package release can be enabled/disabled separately from npm publish.

### Changed

- **MCP reconnect/refresh lifecycle behavior**: MCP connect/refresh failure handling now clears stale cached tools/session state and returns deterministic reconnect outcomes for downstream clients.
- **MCP call argument handling (engine-wide)**: Runtime now normalizes MCP `tools/call` argument keys against tool schema to tolerate common alias/key-shape drift (for example camelCase/snake_case and `name -> task_title` style recovery for required fields).
- **Agent quickstart startup/runtime flow**: Quickstart provider/chat bootstrap behavior now enforces healthier startup gating and surfaces richer run/auth diagnostics for chat sessions.
- **Docs and README alignment**: Updated top-level/docs artifacts for current SDK/runtime behavior, including docs URL and README/README.zh-CN parity refresh.
- **Publish pipeline hardening for TS client**: Updated publish CI flow for `@frumu/tandem-client` to ensure required build/declaration prerequisites are present in publish jobs (`typescript`, DOM lib compatibility, `tsup` + `tsc` path).

### Fixed

- **MCP auth/retry robustness regressions**: Fixed MCP auth challenge handling and reconnect/refresh edge cases that could leave stale cache/tools or unclear auth state after failures.
- **Agent quickstart blank/non-response chat regressions**: Fixed chat flows where runs could appear blank/non-responsive; run failures now surface with clearer diagnostics in UI.
- **Agent quickstart provider setup gating/model handling**: Fixed startup/provider gating and model-selection handling to avoid broken entry states when config is incomplete.
- **Quickstart proxy auth/key routing**: Fixed portal auth handling scope for `/engine` proxy and key/env consistency behavior in quickstart deployment scripts/config.
- **TS client npm publish failures**: Resolved publish failures caused by provenance metadata mismatch and missing CI build/declaration dependencies.

## [0.3.23] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **First official SDK release announcement (TS + Python)**: `0.3.23` is the first Tandem release that formally ships and announces both client SDK packages:
  - TypeScript: `@frumu/tandem-client`
  - Python: `tandem-client`
- **TypeScript SDK token lifecycle mutator**: Added `TandemClient.setToken(token)` in `@frumu/tandem-client` for explicit auth-token updates across future HTTP/SSE calls.

### Changed

- **Agent quickstart SDK migration**: Updated `examples/agent-quickstart` to current TS SDK namespaces and models (providers/channels/permissions/messages/tools/routines), replacing legacy API usage and aligning event/run-state handling.
- **Quickstart client auth wiring**: Refactored quickstart API/auth context to explicit token management helpers (`setClientToken`, `clearClientToken`, `verifyToken`) and removed direct internal-client mutation patterns.
- **Release bump parity (shell + PowerShell)**: Updated `scripts/bump-version.sh` and `scripts/bump-version.ps1` so version bumps include:
  - `packages/tandem-client-ts/package.json`
  - `packages/tandem-client-py/pyproject.toml`

### Fixed

- **Agent quickstart TypeScript build failures**: Resolved compile errors caused by SDK API-shape drift (including invalid imports, outdated method paths, strict type mismatches, and stale event/tool/run field assumptions).

## [0.3.22] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **Engine-first context-driving runtime surfaces**: Expanded context-run APIs and client wiring for event replay, checkpoint access, deterministic next-step selection, and todo->step synchronization so Desktop/TUI consume the same engine-owned truth.
- **Desktop Blackboard panel system**: Added shared Blackboard panel module for Orchestrator + Command Center with docked/expanded/fullscreen modes, decision lineage views, drift details drawer, search/filter controls, and keyboard-first navigation.
- **Blackboard contract test suite**: Added dedicated `test:blackboard` coverage for projection/filtering, follow-mode state transitions, refresh policy, and drift drawer state behavior.

### Changed

- **Blackboard refresh behavior**: Switched to debounced event-driven blackboard refresh with sequence watermarking (`last_blackboard_refresh_seq`) and relevant-event family gating to reduce redundant fetch pressure during long runs.
- **Orchestrator/Command Center parity**: Unified both surfaces on shared blackboard UI/state/policy helpers to keep behavior consistent across run-control entrypoints.
- **Two-pass orchestrator planning**: Planning now performs an analysis pass before DAG generation to improve task quality and reduce low-context first plans.
- **Context-aware execution prompts**: Builder prompts now include continuation context from context-pack summaries so retries/resumes stay on-track instead of restarting from scratch.
- **Planner tool contract alignment**: Planner prompt tool inventory now matches actual runtime tools (`glob/read/write/edit/apply_patch/websearch/webfetch/webfetch_html/codesearch`) and explicitly plans web research when local source material is sparse.
- **Tool path normalization hardening**: File-path normalization now rejects synthetic placeholders like `files/directories` and `tool/policy`, recognizes document extensions (`.pdf/.docx/.pptx/.xlsx/.rtf`), and avoids deriving file paths from assistant narrative context.
- **Release metadata bump**: Updated app/runtime package versions to `0.3.22` for desktop/TUI release alignment.

### Fixed

- **Follow-mode predictability**: Follow now auto-focuses only on new `meta_next_step_selected` decisions and pauses on manual navigation, preventing jumpy recentering on unrelated event noise.
- **Drift/debug visibility**: Added actionable drift and checkpoint navigation affordances with copyable debug payloads for incident triage.
- **Task/session continuity on restart and retry**: Orchestrator now restores task session bindings from checkpoints and preserves failed-task session context by default during retry.
- **Planning/execution token accounting visibility**: Budget token usage now records prompt+response estimates for planner analysis/planner/builder/validator calls, preventing misleading near-zero token displays.
- **Blackboard event coverage for engine runs**: Blackboard projection and refresh logic now recognize orchestrator event families (for example `context_pack_built`, planning/task/run events), improving live context visibility in both Orchestrator and Command Center.
- **Write-required task fail-fast behavior**: Orchestrator now fails fast with explicit errors when builder recovery performs no tool calls or only read-only tool calls on tasks that require file modifications.
- **Read/write sandbox diagnostics and Windows path handling**: Tool path policy now accepts Windows verbatim paths (`\\?\...`) when in-workspace, performs lexical in-workspace checks for non-existent targets, and returns actionable denied-path diagnostics (workspace root/effective cwd/suggested path).
- **Read tool error transparency**: `read` now returns explicit failure reasons (`path_not_found`, `path_is_directory`, `read_text_failed`) instead of silent empty output, reducing retry loops and validator misclassification.
- **Blackboard task-trace visibility**: Blackboard projection/filtering/refresh now includes `task_trace` events (for example `FIRST_TOOL_CALL: glob`) and Orchestrator surfaces paused-run error context directly in the panel.
- **Validator evidence gating for file-output tasks**: Validation prompts now include concrete snippets from changed files and explicitly fail when completion is claimed without verifiable output content.
- **Malformed required-arg tool-call fast timeout**: Pending tool calls that likely omitted required args (for example repeated `read {}`) now time out quickly instead of hanging for long watchdog windows.
- **Provisional tool-start timeout guardrails**: Provisional/partial tool starts (for example `read` before finalized args arrive) no longer trigger the malformed-args fast-timeout path, reducing false `TOOL_TIMEOUT` failures during streamed tool-call assembly.
- **Sidecar `run_conflict` recovery**: Message send/start-run now honors `retryAfterMs` and retries conflict responses instead of surfacing immediate hard failures during active-run handoff.
- **Stale active-run conflict breaker**: Repeated `run_conflict` responses for the same active run now trigger active-run probing and targeted cancellation of stale runs, preventing long conflict retry loops and session thrash.
- **Provider stream failure classification**: Server now maps upstream provider stream/server failures to structured `PROVIDER_SERVER_ERROR` codes for clearer diagnostics and retry behavior.

## [0.3.21]

### Changed

- **Global storage path standardization**: Unified global Tandem state fallbacks across engine/runtime/server/channels/skills/core to OS-native app-data roots (`.../tandem`) with consistent `data`/security/config placement and reduced ad-hoc relative-path defaults.
- **Global storage override support**: Added `TANDEM_HOME` support to shared storage path resolution so operators can pin a canonical global Tandem root explicitly in CI/server environments.

### Fixed

- **Crates publish-order dependency gap**: Added `crates/tandem-agent-teams` to deterministic publish-order manifests/scripts before `crates/tandem-tools`, preventing crates.io publish failures from unresolved intra-release dependency lookup.

## [0.3.20] - 2026-02-25

### Changed

- **TUI agent fanout mode handoff**: `/agent fanout` now auto-switches `plan -> orchestrate` before teammate delegation to reduce plan-mode gating/approval churn during coordinated multi-agent runs.
- **TUI agent-team workflow integration**: Added coordinated fanout team bootstrapping (`TeamCreate` + delegated `task` routing), mailbox/member session binding, and teammate-target normalization (`A2`/`a2`/`agent-2`) to improve local team execution consistency.

### Fixed

- **TUI small-paste readability and composer rendering**: Small pastes (1-2 lines) now insert directly without `[Pasted ...]` tokens, CRLF is normalized, and composer height now expands correctly for explicit newlines (fixes overlapped/cropped second-line input rendering).
- **OpenAI-compatible stream parsing robustness (OpenRouter, tool flows)**: Provider streaming now accepts both `choices[].delta` and `choices[].message` payload shapes for text and tool-call fields, preventing empty assistant replies and missed tool execution when providers return non-delta message chunks.
- **Provider token-budget safety default**: OpenAI-compatible provider requests now set an explicit bounded `max_tokens` default (`2048`, overridable via `TANDEM_PROVIDER_MAX_TOKENS`) to prevent accidental large-budget requests (for example `65536`) that trigger 402 credit failures on simple prompts/tool invocations.

## [0.3.19]

### Changed

- **VPS Stress Lab parity upgrade**: Server-side stress scenarios (`remote`, `file`, `inline`) now execute true async run flows and wait for run completion, aligning Tandem latency measurement with end-to-end provider/tool execution instead of submission-only timing.
- **Cross-system benchmark comparison in portal**: Added OpenCode benchmark ingestion (`latest`, `history`, `by-date`, `health`) and in-UI Tandem vs OpenCode delta reporting for matched stress scenarios.
- **OpenCode benchmark runtime mode**: Added warm attached execution support (`opencode serve` + `run --attach`) to avoid cold-start CLI overhead during repeated benchmark runs.
- **Portal Caddy/API routing compatibility**: Standardized `/api/v1` compatibility behavior and health endpoint support for external benchmark-service integration.
- **TUI interaction model and keyboard UX refresh**: Updated request-center/question handling, mode/status highlighting, sessions UX hints, and command ergonomics (including agent fanout and session delete affordances) for clearer in-terminal workflows.
- **TUI dependency/runtime modernization**: Migrated terminal stack to `ratatui 0.30`/`crossterm 0.29`, replaced third-party throbber dependency with local spinner components, and aligned render paths for better cross-platform behavior.

### Fixed

- **Engine request observability coverage**: Added explicit timing/slow-request instrumentation for `session.command`, `session.get`, and `session.list` server routes to improve bottleneck diagnosis under load.
- **Stress chart rendering stability**: Fixed NaN polyline generation in Stress Lab line charts when metric series are all-zero or sparsely initialized.
- **Server-side model selection for stress runs**: Portal server stress runner now resolves and injects an explicit provider/model for prompt scenarios, preventing misleading providerless-like latency readings in LLM tests.
- **TUI plan/request deadlock and queue conflicts**: Fixed several plan-mode edge cases that could cause repeated `409 session has active run` loops after question/approval handoffs by routing follow-up prompts through safe queue semantics.
- **TUI question answer fidelity and visibility**: Fixed option selection/confirm behavior in compact request mode and added explicit confirmation output showing submitted question answers.
- **TUI paste reliability on Windows**: Added burst-aware paste handling with tokenized placeholders to prevent accidental line-by-line replay, unintended submits, and input corruption during large clipboard pastes.
- **TUI session/task persistence parity**: Restored task reconstruction when re-opening historical sessions by broadening tool-part parsing (`tool`, `tool_call`, `tool_use` forms), so plan sessions reopen with their task lists instead of plain chat-only views.

## [0.3.18]

### Fixed

- **Provider model override from env API-key bootstrap**: Setting `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` no longer forces `providers.openrouter.default_model` to `openai/gpt-4o-mini` in the env layer.
- **Model-selection persistence in VPS/web deployments**: Engine now preserves configured provider default model (for example `z-ai/glm-5`) unless an explicit model env var is set.
- **Config env-layer behavior clarity**: OpenAI-compatible env bootstrap now treats API key and model override separately; model override is applied only when explicitly provided via env.

## [0.3.17]

### Changed

- **Channel session bootstrap defaults**: Channel-created sessions now include a practical default permission set so long-running channel workflows do not silently stall waiting for hidden permission prompts.
- **Channel SSE attach strategy**: Channel run streaming now subscribes at the session level for better compatibility with engines that emit session-scoped events.
- **Portal run observability UX**: Web example dashboards now include richer watchdog/runtime traces and clearer status transitions around stream-ready, run-activity, and poll-finalized completion paths.

### Fixed

- **Run stream event parsing for channels**: Channel dispatcher now consumes `message.part.updated` text deltas and additional terminal run lifecycle variants, improving reply reliability in chat connectors.
- **Telegram diagnostics quality**: Telegram adapter now logs richer poll failure diagnostics (debug transport context + non-success HTTP status/body preview) for production debugging.
- **Permission/approval visibility in portal**: Added global pending-approval visibility and one-click approval action in the portal shell, plus clearer no-pending messaging.
- **Portal SSE reliability in examples**: Web examples now prefer session-level event streaming to avoid runs appearing as `connected/ready` with no live deltas.

## [0.3.16]

### Fixed

- **What's New release-note mismatch**: Desktop now fetches release notes for the installed app tag from GitHub at runtime instead of relying on a hardcoded local markdown import.
- **Safe fallback behavior**: If release-note fetch fails or a version body is unavailable, the What's New overlay shows no stale notes and links users to the latest GitHub release page.
- **Plan task execution integrity**: "Execute Pending Tasks" now uses a strict completion contract and validates task completion from actual `todowrite`-driven todo status updates, not assistant text claims.
- **Pending-task payload correctness**: Chat execution now receives pending-only tasks (instead of all todos), so execution prompts and sidebar counts stay consistent.

## [0.3.15]

### Added

- **Channel slash-command expansion**: Added new channel commands for run control and observability:
  - `/run`
  - `/cancel` (and `/abort` alias)
  - `/todos` (and `/todo` alias)
  - `/requests`
  - `/answer <question_id> <text>`
  - `/providers`
  - `/models [provider]`
- **Channel model switching**: Added `/model <model_id>` to update the default provider's active model from connected chat channels without requiring provider/token switching flows.

### Changed

- **Channel command docs**: Updated channel integration docs/help text to reflect expanded command coverage and model control from chat channels.
- **Provider settings model UX**: Anthropic/OpenAI settings now use text-input-first model selection with updated current model suggestions and clearer provider-specific placeholders.

### Fixed

- **Custom provider config sync (llama-swap/OpenAI-compatible)**: Desktop now writes enabled custom provider endpoint/model into engine config (`providers.custom`) and updates default-provider routing when custom is selected.
- **Custom provider registry support**: Engine provider registry now accepts custom/non-built-in provider IDs from config instead of falling back to `local` only.
- **Custom endpoint normalization hardening**: OpenAI-compatible base URL normalization now handles trailing `/v1`, repeated `/v1/v1`, and full-path inputs (for example `/v1/chat/completions`) to prevent malformed request URLs.
- **Transient provider reachability resilience**: Added short retry behavior for connection/timeout failures when calling OpenAI-compatible providers, reducing one-off local gateway startup hiccups.
- **Settings save feedback**: Saving Custom Provider in Settings now shows explicit success/error feedback instead of silently completing with no user confirmation.
- **Provider error diagnostics**: Provider call failures now include clearer endpoint + failure-category guidance (`connection error` / `timeout`) to speed up local gateway troubleshooting.

## [0.3.14]

### Fixed

- **Endless sidecar update prompt hotfix**: Desktop now avoids preferring stale AppData sidecar binaries when the bundled engine version is newer, preventing false "you have v0.3.0" update loops after upgrading.
- **Version label rendering**: Update UI normalizes engine version labels to avoid duplicated prefixes like `vv0.3.12`.

## [0.3.12]

### Fixed

- **MCP runtime compatibility hotfix**: Desktop now falls back to MCP server `tool_cache` via `GET /mcp` when legacy/mixed engine builds return `404` for `GET /mcp/tools`, preventing Extensions MCP tab load failures (`Failed to load MCP runtime`).
- **Registry publish pipeline ordering**: Fixed crates publish order and dependency coverage in CI scripts/workflow so tandem workspace crate dependencies publish in valid sequence.

## [0.3.11]

### Changed

- **Provider model selection now catalog-backed in Settings**: OpenAI, Anthropic, and OpenCode Zen settings now prefer live engine catalog model IDs when available instead of static-only model lists.

### Fixed

- **Custom provider routing and validation (#14)**: Fixed `custom` provider resolution in desktop Tauri routing so explicit custom provider/model selections dispatch correctly for chat and automation flows.
- **Custom provider selection persistence**: Saving/enabling a custom provider now updates `providers_config.selected_model` when a model is provided, preventing silent fallback to unrelated provider/model selections.
- **Release notes fallback in Settings**: Release notes now fall back to updater `latest.json` metadata when GitHub Releases API fetch fails.
- **Bundled sidecar version reporting**: Sidecar updater status now reports bundled-engine version from app package metadata, avoiding stale beta values from old downloaded sidecar records.

## [0.3.9]

### Added

- **Memory Consolidation**: Added opt-in LLM summarization of session memory using the cheapest available configured provider (prioritizing local/free options like Ollama, Groq, OpenRouter).
- **Channel Tool Policy**: Added explicit policy controls (`allow_all`, `deny_all`, `require_approval`) for tool execution in messaging channels, configurable via `config.json` or `TANDEM_CHANNEL_TOOL_POLICY` env var.
- **Richer Channel Session Metadata**: Upgraded channel session tracking to persist detailed `SessionRecord` metadata (created/last-seen timestamps, channel, sender) instead of bare IDs.
- **Headless Web Admin UI (embedded, single-file)**: Added an embedded `/admin` web interface served directly by `tandem-server` using a baked-in `admin.html` shell (no external assets/build pipeline at runtime).
- **Realtime Admin UX**: Added SSE-driven UI refresh behavior (with polling fallback) for channel/session/memory visibility in the headless admin surface.
- **Channel Admin API surface**: Added channel-management endpoints for headless control:
  - `GET /channels/status`
  - `PUT /channels/{name}`
  - `DELETE /channels/{name}`
  - `POST /admin/reload-config`
- **Memory Admin API surface**: Added browse/delete endpoints for admin workflows:
  - `GET /memory`
  - `DELETE /memory/{id}`
- **Engine CLI web-admin flags**: Added `tandem-engine serve` flags:
  - `--web-ui`
  - `--web-ui-prefix`
- **Desktop Agent Command Center (first integration pass)**: Added an orchestrator-embedded command center UI for Agent Teams with live mission/instance status, spawn controls, and spawn-approval decision actions.
- **Agent-Team approval action endpoints**: Added explicit spawn approval decision routes:
  - `POST /agent-team/approvals/spawn/{id}/approve`
  - `POST /agent-team/approvals/spawn/{id}/deny`
- **Engine memory write/list tools**: Added `memory_store` and `memory_list` tools to `tandem-tools` so agents can persist and audit memory directly from engine tool calls.
- **Global memory opt-in support**: `memory_search` now supports `tier=global` when explicitly enabled via `allow_global=true` or `TANDEM_ENABLE_GLOBAL_MEMORY=1`.
- **Shared memory DB auto-wiring in engine**: `tandem-engine` now auto-configures `TANDEM_MEMORY_DB_PATH` to the shared Tandem `memory.sqlite` path when unset, aligning connected app/tool memory access by default.
- **Engine host runtime context contract**: Added shared `HostRuntimeContext` (`os`, `arch`, `shell_family`, `path_style`) in shared types/wire payloads and surfaced it through engine health/session/run metadata.
- **Server run-start environment observability**: `session.run.started` lifecycle events now include canonical engine environment metadata for cross-client parity.
- **MCP Automated Agents surface (Desktop)**: Added a dedicated `Agent Automation` page (robot-nav entry) for connector operations, scheduled routine wiring, and run triage separate from Command Center orchestration.
- **Mission Workshop (Desktop)**: Added in-page mission drafting assistance that converts plain-language goals into routine objective, success criteria, and suggested execution mode.
- **Ready-made automation templates**: Added starter templates for daily research, issue triage, and release reporting with built-in `webfetch_document` inclusion patterns.
- **Automation run observability UX**: Added per-run event rail chips (`Plan/Do/Verify/Approval/Blocked/Failed`), run filters (`All/Pending/Blocked/Failed`), and run details panel (timeline/reasons/outputs/artifacts).
- **Automation model routing controls**: Added provider/model selection and preset-based model routing for standalone + orchestrated automations, including role model hints for orchestrator/planner/worker/verifier/notifier.
- **Automation model-selection run events**: Added `routine.run.model_selected` emission so selected provider/model and selection source are visible in run streams.

### Changed

- **Headless config/env support**: Added config/env handling for web admin and channel settings (`TANDEM_WEB_UI`, `TANDEM_WEB_UI_PREFIX`, and channel env overlays).
- **Channel runtime wiring**: Wired channel listener lifecycle into server startup/reload flow with status publication events for admin visibility.
- **Security headers for embedded UI**: Added strict response headers/CSP for admin HTML responses.
- **Engine command docs**: Updated engine command reference to include new web-admin flags.
- **Desktop-Tauri agent-team bridge**: Added typed Tauri commands and frontend API wrappers for template/mission/instance/approval listing, spawn, and cancel/decision actions.
- **Startup navigation default**: Desktop now always opens in Chat view on startup (with a TODO for future starter/landing flow) instead of restoring Command Center directly.
- **Command Center observability layout**: Added inline run-scoped Console panel and elevated workspace file browser support in Command Center to improve live swarm debugging.
- **`memory_search` scope policy**: Reworked strict scope enforcement to allow controlled global search while preserving default isolation behavior unless global is explicitly enabled.
- **Engine memory docs/examples**: Expanded CLI and engine README docs with `memory_store`, `memory_list`, and global memory usage examples.
- **Engine prompt assembly (OS-aware)**: `tandem-core` now prepends a deterministic `[Execution Environment]` block (engine-detected OS/shell/path style) to model runs by default (`TANDEM_OS_AWARE_PROMPTS` toggle).
- **Canonical OS authority policy**: Runtime behavior now trusts engine-detected host environment as the source of truth rather than client-provided OS hints.
- **Engine health diagnostics**: `/global/health` now exposes `environment` metadata for troubleshooting and external clients.
- **Routines/automations API compatibility in sidecar bridge**: Desktop routine calls now gracefully fall back to legacy `/routines` endpoints when `/automations` returns `404`, enabling mixed-version app/engine operation.
- **Automation docs expansion**: Added setup and usage guidance for MCP automated agents, provider notes (Arcade/Composio), headless “just run” flow, model-routing examples, and release-readiness test checklist.

### Fixed

- **Command Center tool-arg hardening**: `read`/`write` tool calls now validate argument shape (`JSON object` + non-empty `path`) and fail fast with structured `INVALID_TOOL_ARGS` instead of retry loops.
- **Workspace/path error taxonomy**: Replaced broad Windows `os error 3` pause messaging with clearer classification (`WORKSPACE_NOT_FOUND`, path-not-found fail-fast) so runs stop/recover deterministically.
- **Orchestrator retry-loop suppression**: Invalid tool args and path-not-found failures now fail task attempts directly instead of repeatedly re-queuing.
- **Task session workspace pinning**: Child task sessions are now pinned to the orchestrator workspace path, with preflight checks before session creation.
- **Workspace switch propagation (CC-001)**: New runs now persist canonical `workspace_root` and inject explicit workspace/cwd into tool execution so file ops resolve against the selected Command Center workspace (not stale process CWD).
- **Workspace hot-switch engine invalidation (CC-001)**: Switching active project now invalidates stale in-memory orchestrator engines bound to other workspaces, preventing cross-workspace drift in subsequent runs.
- **Selected Run objective readability (CC-002)**: Added inline objective truncation with `Show more` / `Show less` toggle so large prompts no longer overwhelm the Selected Run panel by default.
- **Runs list status visibility (CC-003)**: Runs now surface status badges, start/end timestamps, and last-error snippets in Command Center for faster state triage without digging through logs.
- **Tool timeout resilience for file ops**: Increased `read`/`write` tool timeouts to reduce premature synthetic terminal errors on larger workspaces.
- **Tool history ID collision fix**: Tool execution IDs now include session/message/part context (not just `part_id`) to prevent cross-session overwrite/correlation drift.
- **Structured stream error codes**: Stream tool/session terminal events now carry optional `error_code` metadata for clearer diagnostics in orchestrator + UI.
- **Builder prompt guardrails**: Builder-agent prompt now explicitly requires valid JSON tool args and non-empty `path` for file tools.

- **Desktop channel token persistence across restart**: Fixed a vault-unlock/startup race where channel bot tokens (Telegram/Discord/Slack) could fail to rehydrate into sidecar env before restart, causing saved channel connections to appear unconfigured after engine/app restart.
- **Model/provider routing hardening**: Chat, queue, rewind, undo, and command-center/orchestrator dispatches now require explicit provider+model instead of silently falling back.
- **Model selection persistence**: Fixed picker drift by persisting `providers_config.selected_model` from both Chat and Command Center selectors.
- **Provider runtime model override**: Provider calls now honor per-request model overrides, preventing unintended fallback execution (for example `gpt-4o-mini` when another model is selected).
- **OpenRouter attribution**: Added consistent request attribution headers so calls are identified as Tandem instead of unknown source.
- **Memory startup self-heal**: Corrupted/incompatible vector DB state is now detected, backed up, and auto-recovered to prevent repeated startup failures (`chunks iter error` / SQL logic errors).
- **Command Center task state/UI correctness**: Fixed paused/failed run status mapping and disabled launch actions while a run is already active to prevent duplicate swarm starts.
- **Autonomous swarm permission flow**: Orchestrator/Command Center sessions now auto-allow shell tool permissions in autonomous mode (no manual approve gate for each call).
- **Shell-call robustness**: Empty shell invocations now fail fast with explicit `BASH_COMMAND_MISSING` instead of hanging until watchdog timeout.
- **Windows shell compatibility**: Added Windows translation for common Unix shell calls used by agents (`ls -la`, `find ... -type f -name ...`) to PowerShell equivalents.
- **Stream watchdog noise reduction**: Suppressed false stream-degraded watchdog events while tools are actively pending.
- **Failed task recovery in Command Center**: Added per-task retry support that re-queues failed tasks, clears stale task failure state, and unblocks dependent tasks without forcing full run restart.
- **Failed task diagnostics clarity**: Failed task cards now surface richer validator/error detail so failure causes are visible in-place instead of opaque `session.error` noise.
- **Engine tool memory path mismatch**: Fixed default `memory_search`/memory tool DB resolution in headless engine runs by setting the shared memory DB path at runtime when not already provided.
- **Memory tool test coverage**: Added/updated tests to validate global-memory opt-in gates and prevent accidental unrestricted global access.
- **Cross-platform shell execution path**: Non-Windows engine shell tool execution now uses POSIX shell (`sh -lc`) instead of hardcoded PowerShell fallback.
- **Windows shell mismatch loops**: Expanded Windows shell guardrails to translate common Unix patterns, block unsafe Unix-only commands with structured guidance, and emit `os_guardrail_applied`/`guardrail_reason` metadata.
- **OS mismatch retry suppression**: Engine loop now suppresses repeated identical shell calls after path/shell mismatch signatures and steers model/tool flow toward cross-platform tools (`read`, `glob`, `grep`).
- **OS mismatch error taxonomy**: Server dispatch now classifies common path/shell mismatch failures as `OS_MISMATCH` for clearer diagnostics.
- **Automation endpoint 404 startup noise**: Reduced desktop sidecar error loops/circuit-breaker churn when new automation routes are unavailable on older engines via endpoint fallback handling.
- **Automation model policy validation**: Hardened create/patch validation for `model_policy` shape (`default_model`, `role_models.*` with required `provider_id` + `model_id`) and explicit clear semantics (`model_policy: {}` on patch).

## [0.3.7] - 2026-02-18

### Changed

- **Complete Simplified Chinese overwrite**: Replaced and normalized Simplified Chinese copy across major app surfaces, including startup messaging, settings, About page, theme picker, provider cards, packs metadata, and skills guidance.
- **Localization completeness pass**: Converted remaining hardcoded English strings in key screens to i18n keys and filled missing `zh-CN` locale coverage.
- **Language UX polish**: Improved live language switching consistency and ensured parity-safe locale catalogs for `en`/`zh-CN`.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

- **TUI stale shared-engine attach**: TUI now checks connected engine version during startup and applies stale-policy gating before attaching to an existing shared engine.
- **Default self-healing startup**: Added `TANDEM_ENGINE_STALE_POLICY` with default `auto_replace` so stale engines are replaced by a fresh managed engine automatically.
- **Port collision recovery**: When default/shared engine port is occupied by a stale process, TUI now falls back to an available local port for managed startup.
- **Runtime visibility**: `/engine status` now reports required engine version, stale policy, and connection source (`shared-attached` vs `managed-local`) to make diagnosis deterministic.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Agent Teams MVP in engine server**: Added mission/instance spawning foundations with shared server-side spawn policy enforcement, role edges, budget/cap controls, capability scopes, SKILL.md hashing, and structured agent-team SSE events for command-center style observability.
- **Agent Teams API/docs surface**: Added new guide docs for rollout, API/events, spawn policy, and protocol matrix updates; added crate-level READMEs for `tandem-ai` and `tandem-tui` with cargo-first usage.
- **Separate Registry Publish Workflow**: Added isolated GitHub Actions registry workflow (`publish-registries.yml`) for crates.io + npm publishing with dedicated triggers, environment gates, and dry-run support.
- **CI Publish Scripts**: Added CI-safe publish helpers for crates and npm (`scripts/publish-crates-ci.sh`, `scripts/publish-npm-ci.sh`, `scripts/publish-npm-ci.ps1`) with idempotent skip behavior for already-published versions.

### Changed

- **Publish chain hardening**: Reworked crate publish/version dependency chain so new crate releases resolve correctly in order, including updated crate versions for `tandem-memory`, `tandem-tools`, `tandem-core`, `tandem-server`, `tandem-tui`, and `tandem-ai`.
- **Release metadata bump**: Bumped app/wrapper versions to `0.3.5` across `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and npm wrapper package manifests.
- **npm Wrapper Bin Layout**: Updated `@frumu/tandem` and `@frumu/tandem-tui` wrappers to ship stable JS bin launchers (`bin/*.js`) and use `bin/native/*` for downloaded binaries, improving npm/pnpm shim generation reliability.
- **npm Wrapper Postinstall**: Simplified wrapper postinstall command to `node scripts/install.js` to avoid package-manager-specific env var path issues.
- **Release Docs**: Expanded release process docs to include the new separate registry publish flow.

### Fixed

- **Windows publish-verify blocker**: Removed reliance on `--no-verify` workaround path by making `tandem-memory` publish verification resilient without dragging problematic static-CRT tokenizer/embedder linkage into default verification builds.
- **Wrapper/crate docs mismatch**: Clarified npm wrapper READMEs and added proper crate README instructions to prevent `npm install` guidance from leaking into crate-level workflows.
- **Cross-platform Wrapper Install Reliability**: Fixed Windows/pnpm failures where bin shims were not created before postinstall and where postinstall path resolution could fail in some package-manager environments.
- **TUI Sidecar Engine Freshness**: TUI now detects stale cached/bundled sidecar engine binaries and auto-refreshes them based on version comparison, preventing old sidecar versions from being reused.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- **TUI PIN startup flow**: Startup now correctly enters unlock mode whenever a vault key exists, preventing repeated create-PIN prompts across restarts.
- **TUI provider key onboarding**: First-run setup now opens when no provider keys exist in the unlocked keystore, so provider API key entry is no longer skipped.
- **TUI onboarding state logic**: Startup PIN detection and provider onboarding checks now use separate, correct signals (vault existence vs. configured keys).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- **TUI Provider Gating**: TUI startup/provider catalog handling now excludes the fallback `local` provider from configured-provider checks, preventing chat/session flow from starting without a real provider setup.
- **Provider Setup UX Consistency**: Key/setup checks now consistently use sanitized provider catalogs so `/key test` and startup gating match wizard behavior.
- **Desktop StreamHub Restart Recovery**: Sidecar `/event` subscription failures during startup/restart are now treated as transient for circuit-breaker accounting, preventing repeated `503` retries from opening the breaker and delaying recovery.
- **Desktop StreamHub Error Noise**: StreamHub now classifies common sidecar-transition subscription failures as recovering state retries instead of emitting repeated hard error telemetry/log spam.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **Engine-Native Mission Runtime**: Added mission APIs (`POST /mission`, `GET /mission`, `GET /mission/{id}`, `POST /mission/{id}/event`) backed by shared orchestrator reducer state.
- **Shared Orchestrator Crate**: Introduced `crates/tandem-orchestrator` with reusable mission models (`MissionSpec`, `MissionState`, `WorkItem`, `MissionEvent`, `MissionCommand`) and reducer interface.
- **Default Mission Gates**: Added reviewer/tester reducer transitions with rework handling and completion signaling.
- **Shared Resources Blackboard**: Added revisioned shared resource store + APIs (`GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE /resource/{*key}`, `GET /resource?prefix=...`) and SSE stream (`GET /resource/events`).
- **Status Indexer**: Added engine-derived run status indexing into shared resources (`run/{sessionID}/status`) from session/tool events.
- **Memory Governance APIs**: Added scoped memory endpoints (`POST /memory/put`, `POST /memory/promote`, `POST /memory/search`, `GET /memory/audit`) with capability checks and partition validation.
- **Tiered Memory Promotion Pipeline**: Added scrub + audit promotion flow for `session/project/team/curated` memory tiers with explicit promotion controls.
- **Routine Scheduler + APIs**: Added routine persistence/scheduler and APIs (`POST/GET /routines`, `PATCH/DELETE /routines/{id}`, `POST /routines/{id}/run_now`, `GET /routines/{id}/history`, `GET /routines/events`).
- **Routine Policy Gates**: Added external side-effect gates emitting lifecycle events (`routine.fired`, `routine.approval_required`, `routine.blocked`) with history states.
- **Desktop + TUI Mission/Routine Parity**: Added Desktop sidecar + TUI client command parity for mission/routine observe/control workflows.
- **TUI Composer Upgrade**: Added multiline composer state with cursor navigation, delete-forward, and native paste event handling in `tandem-tui`.
- **TUI Markdown/Stream Pipeline**: Added tandem-local markdown renderer + newline-gated stream collector with reducer-level tail-flush correctness tests.
- **TUI Long-Transcript Performance Harness**: Added virtualization parity tests and ignored benchmark target for large transcript render profiling.

### Security

- **Provider Secret Drift Fix**: Re-aligned engine auth flow to prevent provider API keys from being persisted via config patch APIs.
- **Runtime Auth Source**: `PUT /auth/{provider}` now applies provider keys to runtime-only engine config state and reloads providers without writing secrets to disk.
- **Config Secret Rejection**: `PATCH /config` and `PATCH /global/config` now reject secret-bearing fields (`api_key`, `apiKey`) with `400 CONFIG_SECRET_REJECTED`.
- **Response Redaction**: Config API responses continue to redact secret fields so provider credentials are never returned in plaintext API payloads.

### Changed

- **Platform Boundary Formalization**: Moved to engine-first orchestrator ownership for durable mission/resource/routine state, with Desktop/TUI as control-center clients.
- **Release Contract Stability**: Promoted mission and routine event families to stable SDK contracts after snapshot and client-parity verification.
- **Design Control Plane**: Added/standardized architecture control docs (`docs/design/*`) with linked workboard/progress/decisions workflow (`W-###`).
- **TUI Key Sync Transport**: TUI now syncs unlocked keystore credentials to engine runtime via `/auth/{provider}` instead of writing keys through `/config`.
- **Desktop Runtime Auth Sync**: Desktop now pushes provider credentials to sidecar runtime auth after sidecar start/restart, aligning with keystore-first secret handling.
- **Config Layers**: Added an in-memory runtime config layer for ephemeral provider auth material (merged into effective config, never persisted).
- **TUI Transcript Rendering**: Replaced `tui-markdown` usage with tandem-local `pulldown-cmark` rendering and virtualized transcript line materialization.
- **TUI Render Throughput**: Added bounded per-message render cache (message fingerprint + width keyed) to reduce repeated markdown/wrap work per frame.

### Fixed

- **Spec/API Drift**: Synced docs with implemented APIs (including routine delete and memory audit routes) and cleaned stale orchestrator roadmap claims from active specs.
- **Progress Tracking Integrity**: Repaired progress log table formatting and upgraded phase tracking to continue under `W-016+` control-plane flow.
- **Plaintext Key Persistence Gap**: Fixed a regression where provider API keys could end up in Tandem config files under `%APPDATA%/tandem` when clients used config patch flows.
- **OpenRouter Auth Regression After Scrub**: Fixed post-scrub provider failures by wiring runtime auth to provider resolution instead of relying on persisted config secrets.
- **Browser CORS for Engine API**: Added CORS support to engine HTTP routes so browser-based examples using `X-Tandem-Token` work with preflight requests.
- **TUI Stream Merge Regression**: Prevented regressive success/failure snapshots from overwriting richer locally-finalized assistant stream tails.

## [0.3.0-rc.2] - 2026-02-15

- **TUI Error Recall Command**: Added `/last_error` to quickly print the most recent prompt/system failure message.
- **TUI Working Indicator**: Added active-agent working status/spinner visibility in chat footer and grid pane titles.
- **TUI Request Center**: Added pending-request modal (`Alt+R` / `/requests`) for permission approvals and interactive question replies.
- **Shared Permission Defaults**: Added centralized permission-default rule builder in `tandem-core` for desktop + TUI consistency.
- **Skills Discovery Expansion**: Added multi-root skills discovery in `tandem-skills` for project and ecosystem directories (`.tandem/skill`, `.tandem/skills`, `~/.tandem/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, plus appdata compatibility).
- **Agent Skill Activation Controls**: Added optional `skills` field to agent frontmatter/config so end users can scope which skills are active per agent.
- **Strict `memory_search` Tool**: Added a new `memory_search` tool in `tandem-tools` with strict scope enforcement (requires `session_id` and/or `project_id`, blocks global-tier searches, validates tier/scope combinations).
- **Embedding Health API Surface**: Added shared embedding health (`status` + `reason`) in memory runtime types and manager API for UI/event consumption.

### Changed

- **Frontend history**: Added debounce to history refresh to prevent excessive re-fetching.
- **TUI key bindings**: Improved TUI key handling and help interface.
- **Scripts**: Updated benchmarking and sidecar download scripts.
- **Engine Default Port**: Standardized default engine endpoint to `127.0.0.1:39731` (away from common frontend port `3000`) with env overrides (`TANDEM_ENGINE_PORT`, `TANDEM_ENGINE_HOST`, `TANDEM_ENGINE_URL`).
- **Desktop/TUI Endpoint Alignment**: Desktop sidecar + TUI now share centralized default port configuration and honor env overrides for connection/spawn behavior.
- **Engine Testing Docs**: Updated `ENGINE_TESTING.md` examples to use `tandem-ai` crate commands and the new default engine port.

- **Keystore Key Mapping**: TUI now normalizes legacy/local keystore key names (e.g. `openrouter_key`, `*_api_key`, `opencode_*_api_key`) to canonical provider IDs before syncing to engine config.
- **Keystore -> Engine Sync**: On connect, TUI now syncs unlocked local keystore provider keys into engine provider config to keep desktop/TUI auth behavior consistent.
- **TUI Startup Order**: Startup now performs engine bootstrap check/download before allowing transition to PIN entry, keeping users on the matrix/connect screen until engine install is ready.
- **TUI Download UX**: Engine download view now shows byte-based progress (downloaded/total) with install phase text and last-error status on failures.
- **Transcript Rendering**: Chat flow renderer now wraps long lines for readable error/output text in narrow terminals.
- **Windows Dev Docs**: Expanded `ENGINE_TESTING.md` with PowerShell-safe build/copy/run commands and bash-vs-PowerShell clarity.
- **TUI Keybinds/UX**: Grid toggle moved to `Alt+G`; request center added on `Alt+R`; scroll speed increased for line/page scrolling.
- **Startup + PIN UX**: PIN prompt re-centered for fullscreen, digit-only PIN input enforced, and connecting screen now stays active until engine readiness checks complete.
- **Markdown Pipeline**: TUI transcript path now uses `tui-markdown` preprocessing for assistant markdown content.
- **Mode Tool Gating**: `skill` is now universal at mode level (not blocked by mode `allowed_tools` allowlists).
- **Skill Tool Scope Behavior**: `skill` now respects agent-level equipped skill lists when present (filtered list/load), while still being callable from all modes.
- **Memory Crate Integration**: `src-tauri` now consumes `crates/tandem-memory` directly via re-export facade and removed duplicated local memory implementation files.
- **Memory/Embedding UX Telemetry**: `memory_retrieval` stream events and memory settings now include embedding health fields (`embedding_status`, `embedding_reason`), and chat/settings UI surface those states.
- **Memory Telemetry Persistence**: Memory lifecycle events are now persisted into tool history (`memory.lookup`, `memory.store`) so session reloads can rehydrate memory badges and console entries.
- **Chat Memory Badge Reliability**: Chat now buffers memory telemetry that can arrive before assistant content chunks and deterministically attaches it to the next assistant message.

### Fixed

- **Desktop Permission Routing**: Permission prompts now stay scoped to the active session, preventing cross-session/parallel-client approval leakage into the wrong chat.
- **Question Overlay Recovery**: Desktop now normalizes `permission(tool=question)` into question-request UI flow so walkthrough prompts consistently appear in the modal.
- **Plan Mode Todo Reliability**: Fixed repeated `todo_write` no-op loops (`0 items`) by normalizing common todo payload aliases (`tasks`, `items`, checklist/text forms) and skipping empty todo calls.
- **Plan Mode Clarification Flow**: When planning cannot produce concrete todos, the engine now emits a structured `question.asked` fallback instead of silently proceeding with prose-only clarification.
- **Todo Fallback Precision**: Todo extraction fallback now ignores plain prose and only derives tasks from structured checklist/numbered lines, preventing accidental phantom tasks.
- **Silent Prompt Failures in TUI**: Stream failures are now surfaced from runtime events (`session.error` and failed `session.run.finished`) instead of appearing as no-response hangs.
- **Run Stream Stability**: Fixed run-scoped SSE handling so unrelated events do not prematurely terminate active stream processing.
- **No-Response Completion Case**: Added explicit fallback error messaging when a run completes without streamed deltas or assistant content.
- **Provider Auth in TUI**: Fixed a key-discovery mismatch that prevented existing desktop-stored keys from being recognized by TUI.
- **Engine Download Retry in TUI**: Download failures no longer lock out retries for the remainder of the process; retry/backoff now allows recovery without restarting TUI.
- **Debug Engine Bootstrap Fallback**: Debug builds now fall back to release download when no local dev engine binary is found.
- **Keystore Corruption Routing**: Unreadable/corrupt keystore files now route to create/recovery behavior instead of trapping users in unlock failures.
- **Request Visibility**: Replaced noisy in-transcript request activity lines with dedicated request/status UI.
- **Permission Clarity in Plan Mode**: Request modal now shows mode/tool context and explains why permission is requested, including `tool: question` previews.
- **Question Handling**: Added custom-answer support alongside multiple-choice options and fixed `permission(tool=question)` normalization into question-answer flow.
- **Skills Discovery Determinism**: Duplicate skill names are now resolved by deterministic priority (project roots override global roots).
- **Windows `tandem-memory` Test Linking**: Fixed MSVC CRT mismatch (`LNK2038`, `MT_StaticRelease` vs `MD_DynamicRelease`) by vendoring/patching `esaxx-rs` to avoid static CRT linkage in this workspace.
- **Corrupt Memory DB Startup Recovery**: Added SQLite integrity validation (`PRAGMA quick_check`) at memory DB startup so malformed databases are detected and auto-backed-up/reset before runtime writes.
- **Session Rehydration Gaps**: Fixed missing memory retrieval/storage telemetry after reload by rehydrating persisted memory rows into assistant message badges and console history.
- **Idle Stream Health**: Stream watchdog no longer marks the desktop stream as degraded when idle without active runs or tool calls.

## [0.3.0-rc.1] - 2026-02-14

### Added

### Docs

- **Engine Testing Guide**: Added tool testing workflows, size savings example, and Windows quickstart for tauri dev.

### Fixed

- **Websearch Empty-Args Failures**: Prevented repeated `websearch` executions with `{}` by recovering/inferencing queries and emitting explicit terminal errors when unrecoverable.
- **Websearch Looping**: Added read-only dedupe and loop-guard controls for repeated identical `websearch` calls.
- **Provider Auth Error Clarity**: Provider auth failures now emit provider-specific API key guidance (for example OpenRouter key hints).
- **Desktop External Links**: Markdown links in assistant messages now open reliably through Tauri opener integration.

## [0.2.25] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **Marketing Skills Canonical Map**: Added `docs/marketing_skill_canonical_map.md` to document no-duplicate routing and fallback strategy.

### Changed

- **Skill Template Install Behavior**: `skills_install_template` now installs the full template directory recursively (not just `SKILL.md`), so bundled `references/`, scripts, and assets ship with installs.
- **Marketing Starter Ordering**: Updated `SkillsPanel` recommendations to prioritize canonical marketing skills over legacy/fallback templates for marketing-intent discovery.
- **Shared Marketing Context Path**: Replaced `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` references with `scripts/marketing/_shared/product-marketing-context.md` and included shared context template references.

### Fixed

## [0.2.24] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **Custom Modes (Phased MVP Complete)**: Added end-to-end custom mode support with backend-authoritative enforcement, including mode listing, create/update/delete, import/export, deterministic precedence (`builtin < user < project`), and safe fallback behavior.
- **Guided Mode Builder**: Added a non-technical, step-by-step mode creation wizard in `Extensions -> Modes`.
- **Mode Management in Extensions**: Added a dedicated `Modes` area under `Extensions` with `Guided Builder` and `Advanced Editor` views.
- **AI-Assisted Mode Builder**: Added optional AI assist flow in Guided Builder with:
  - `Start AI Builder Chat`
  - paste-and-parse JSON preview before apply
  - new bundled skill template: `mode-builder`
- **Mode Icons**: Added selectable mode icons that render in chat mode selector UI.

### Changed

- **Chat Mode Selector**: Mode selector now loads built-in + custom modes dynamically and uses compact descriptions for custom entries.
- **Memory Indexing Default**: `auto_index_on_project_load` now defaults to `true` for new users/devices.

### Fixed

- **Version Metadata Sync**: Updated `tauri.conf.json`, `package.json`, and `Cargo.toml` so auto-updates detect new releases correctly.

## [0.2.23] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **Global Activity Indicators**: Added top-right runtime badges for concurrent background work (`CHATTING` and `ORCHESTRATING` counts) so active work remains visible while navigating between sessions/views.
- **Session List Running State UX**: Added explicit running status indicators in the Sessions sidebar for active chat sessions and orchestrator runs.
- **Orchestrator Budget Controls**: Added in-panel budget actions so users can extend run limits (`Add Budget Headroom`) or relax caps for long-running orchestrations (`Relax Max Caps`) without starting over.

### Changed

- **Session Selection Behavior**: Selecting a normal chat session now exits Orchestrator panel mode and clears stale selected run context.
- **Sidebar Status Presentation**: Refined running indicators to avoid duplicate spinners and keep status signal in a consistent location (`RUNNING` on the metadata line).
- **Chat Activity Accounting**: Chat running counts now derive from global sidecar stream events (session-scoped), not only the currently mounted chat component state.

### Fixed

- **Orchestrator Console Persistence**: Fixed orchestrator Console tab history clearing on drawer reopen by scoping logs to run sessions and loading persisted tool events across base + task child sessions.
- **Orchestrator Console Live Scope**: Fixed Console stream bleed by filtering live tool events to only the orchestrator run's related session IDs.
- **Orchestrator Retry Error Visibility**: Fixed retry/restart failures being visible only in logs by surfacing run failure reasons directly in Orchestrator UI alerts.
- **Orchestrator Failure Context**: Improved terminal failure messaging to include concrete failed-task error details (e.g. provider/model-not-found) instead of generic max-retry text.
- **Orchestrator Budget Recovery**: Fixed budget-limit dead ends by allowing failed budget runs to move back to resumable state after caps are increased.
- **Concurrent Chat Session Indicators**: Fixed sidebar/chat-header indicators dropping when switching selection by tracking running sessions globally and rendering status per session ID.
- **Budget Warning Log Spam**: Throttled repetitive orchestrator budget warning logs (e.g. `wall_time at 80%`) to log on meaningful threshold progression/cooldown instead of every loop tick.

## [0.2.22] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed

- **Orchestrator Run Isolation by Project**: Prevented Orchestrator mode from reusing a stale run across projects by clearing selected run state when switching/adding projects and scoping run selection to the active workspace.
- **Orchestrator Auto-Resume Behavior**: Opening Orchestrator with no explicit run now auto-resumes only active runs (`planning`, `awaiting_approval`, `executing`, `paused`) instead of reopening terminal/completed history by default.

## [0.2.21] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Model Selector Provider Filter**: Added an explicit provider selector inside the chat model dropdown (`All` + visible providers) so users can narrow large catalogs without horizontal scrolling.
- **Provider-Aware Search Token**: Added `provider:<id-or-name>` support in model search (for example `provider:openrouter sonnet`) to quickly scope results from the keyboard.

### Changed

- **Model Selector UX**: Replaced horizontal provider chips with a compact full-width provider dropdown for better scalability with many providers.
- **Model Selector Clarity**: Added helper copy ("Showing configured providers + local") to explain why some providers are hidden by default.
- **Provider Filter Behavior**: Provider filters now reset safely to `All` when a previously selected provider is no longer available after model reload.

### Fixed

- **Provider-Scoped Empty State**: Empty states in model selection now explain when no matches exist for the active provider filter.
- **Fullscreen File Preview Readability**: Increased fullscreen preview opacity and backdrop strength so file content remains readable on highly transparent/gradient themes (e.g. Pink Pony) instead of blending into the app background.

## [0.2.20] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Sidecar Update Compatibility Metadata**: Sidecar status now exposes `latestOverallVersion` and `compatibilityMessage` so the UI can clearly explain when newest overall and newest compatible releases differ.
- **Global Stream Hub**: Added a single long-lived sidecar stream substrate (`stream_hub`) that fans out events to chat, orchestrator, and Ralph, reducing duplicate subscriptions and race-prone stream wiring.
- **Event Envelope v2 (Additive)**: Added `sidecar_event_v2` with envelope metadata (`event_id`, `correlation_id`, `ts_ms`, `session_id`, `source`, `payload`) while keeping legacy `sidecar_event` for compatibility.
- **Stream Health Signaling**: Added explicit stream health events (`healthy`, `degraded`, `recovering`) emitted from the backend and surfaced in chat UI.
- **Chat Message Queue IPC**: Added queue APIs for busy-agent workflows: `queue_message`, `queue_list`, `queue_remove`, `queue_send_next`, `queue_send_all`.
- **Skills Import Preview + Conflict Policies**: Added `skills_import_preview` and `skills_import` with deterministic conflict strategies: `skip`, `overwrite`, `rename`.
- **Skills Pack/Zip Import Support**: Added multi-skill zip import parsing (`SKILL.md` discovery) with pre-apply preview summary.
- **Richer Skill Metadata Surface**: Expanded skill metadata handling to include `version`, `author`, `tags`, `requires`, `compatibility`, and `triggers`.

### Fixed

- **OpenCode Sidecar Release Discovery**: Sidecar update checks now query GitHub Releases with pagination (`per_page=20`, multi-page) instead of relying on a single latest path.
- **Update Target Selection**: Sidecar updater now selects the newest compatible release for the current platform/architecture by filtering assets from release metadata and skipping drafts (and prereleases unless beta channel is enabled).
- **Rate Limit Resilience**: Added conditional GitHub requests (`If-None-Match`, `If-Modified-Since`), local release-cache reuse, and check debouncing to reduce API pressure and improve reliability when offline/rate-limited.
- **Version Comparison Correctness**: Updater now uses semantic version comparison (with fallback parsing) to prevent incorrect update prompts from string-based version checks.
- **Sidecar Update Messaging**: Improved update overlay messaging to surface compatibility context instead of always presenting newest-tag text.
- **Console History Persistence**: Fixed historical tool executions not loading in the Console tab by correctly parsing persisted `type: "tool"` messages (which differ from live streaming format) and simplifying part-ID resolution.
- **Chat Jump Button**: Fixed "Jump to latest" button floating in the middle of the view by positioning it as an absolute overlay at the bottom of the message area, independent of scroll content height.
- **Streaming Subscription Duplication**: Eliminated per-request stream subscription in `send_message_streaming`; message streaming now uses shared stream bus events, reducing duplicate event emission risks.
- **Memory Retrieval Event Handling in Chat**: Wired frontend handling for `memory_retrieval` stream events so retrieval telemetry is now visible in the active chat flow.
- **Orchestrator/Ralph Stream Contention**: Migrated orchestrator and Ralph loop event consumption to stream-hub fanout instead of opening independent sidecar event feeds.
- **Chat Event Duplication Under Load**: Added deterministic frontend dedupe keyed by `event_id` for v2 stream envelopes.

### Changed

- **Streaming Architecture**: Shifted Tandem to a hub-first streaming model with additive v2 envelopes and backward-compatible legacy event emission during migration.
- **Chat UX During Generation**: Pressing Enter while generation is active now queues messages (FIFO) with inline queue controls for send-next/send-all/remove.
- **Tool Activity Presentation**: Updated inline assistant tool summary to show compact process-oriented status (step count, running/pending/failed counts, duration) with detail drill-down retained.

## [0.2.19] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Memory Retrieval Telemetry**: Chat requests now run memory retrieval before sending prompts, emit a `memory_retrieval` stream event, and include balanced telemetry (usage, chunk counts, latency, score range, short query hash) without logging raw query text or chunk contents.
- **Chat Memory Badge**: Assistant responses now show a memory capsule with a brain icon and retrieval status (used/not used, chunks, latency) for verifiable retrieval visibility per response.
- **Console Tab (Logs Drawer)**: Added a dedicated Console tab for tool-execution events and approvals in the Logs drawer workflow.

### Fixed

- **Memory Retrieval Coverage**: Wired retrieval context injection into both `send_message` and `send_message_streaming` so normal chat requests can actually use indexed vector memory.
- **Sidecar Duplicate Spawn Race**: Prevented duplicate OpenCode/Bun sidecar launches by serializing sidecar start/stop lifecycle transitions with a lifecycle lock.
- **Logs Drawer Fullscreen Height**: Fixed logs panel sizing so height is fully dynamic in fullscreen instead of staying at the smaller constrained height.
- **Logs Redundancy**: Removed the redundant OpenCode sidecar log tab from the logs viewer and consolidated command activity under the Console tab.
- **Pink Pony Readability**: Tuned Pink Pony theme contrast, surface opacity, borders, and text colors to improve legibility on bright backgrounds.
- **Chat Performance**: Significantly improved rendering performance for long chat sessions by implementing list virtualization and component memoization.
- **Production Build**: Fixed a TypeScript error in the Logs Drawer component (`ResizeObserver` type mismatch) that was blocking production builds.

### Changed

- **Memory Log Signal**: Memory retrieval logging now uses a distinct `tandem.memory` target and a brain marker for easier scanning in logs.
- **Production Frontend Build**: Production Vite builds now drop `console.*` and `debugger` statements.

## [0.2.18] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **Python**: Auto-open the Python Setup (Workspace Venv) wizard when Python is blocked by venv-only policy enforcement (helps LLM-triggered Python attempts recover quickly).
- **Python**: Extend venv-only enforcement to staged/batch execution (preflight staged operations before approving any tool calls).
- **Python**: Add a shared policy helper + tests for consistent enforcement across approval paths.
- **Packs (Python)**: Add `requirements.txt` to the Data Visualization and Finance Analysis packs; update their docs to install via the workspace venv.
- **Packs**: Install pack-level `CONTRIBUTING.md` when present (copied alongside `START_HERE.md`).
- **Files**: Add a dock mount + fullscreen toggle for file previews.

### Fixed

- **Skills/Templates**: Fix bundled starter skill templates with missing YAML frontmatter fields so they no longer get skipped on startup.
- **Python**: Improve the requirements install UX by defaulting to the workspace and auto-detecting `requirements*.txt` when present.

### Known Issues

- **Files Auto-Refresh (WIP)**: The Files tree does not reliably refresh when tools/AI create new files in the workspace. Deeper investigation needed; workaround is to navigate away and back to Files.

## [0.2.17] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- **Custom Background Opacity Slider (Packaged Builds)**: Fix opacity changes causing the background image to flash or disappear in bundled builds by keeping the resolved image URL stable and updating only opacity.
- **Background Layering**: Render the custom background image as a dedicated fixed layer so it consistently appears across views without impacting overlay layout.

## [0.2.16] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- **Update Overlay Layout**: Fix the in-app update prompt becoming constrained/squished due to theme background layering CSS.

## [0.2.15] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- **Custom Background Image Loading (Packaged Builds)**: Fix custom background images failing to load after updating by falling back to an in-memory `data:` URL when the `asset:` URL fails.

## [0.2.14] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **Themes: Background Art Pass**: Add richer background art for Cosmic Glass (starfield + galaxy glow), Pink Pony (thick arcing rainbow), and Zen Dusk (minimalist ink + sage haze).
- **Theme Background Support**: Add an `app-background` utility class so gradient theme backgrounds render correctly throughout the app (not just as a solid `background-color`).
- **Custom Background Image Overlay**: Allow users to choose a background image (copied into app data) and overlay it on top of the active theme, with an opacity slider in Settings.
- **File Text Extraction (Rust)**: Add best-effort, cross-platform text extraction for common document formats (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX/XLS/ODS/XLSB, RTF) via the `read_file_text` command so attachments can be used by skills without requiring Python.
- **Python Workspace Venv Wizard**: Add a cross-platform in-app Python setup wizard to create a workspace-scoped venv at `.opencode/.venv` and install dependencies into it (never global).
- **Docs: Theme Contribution Guide**: Add guidance for creating and iterating on theme backgrounds.

### Fixed

- **Settings/About/Extensions Navigation**: Restore Settings/About/Extensions panels after a regression where these views would not appear.
- **Overlay Layering**: Ensure theme/background layers render consistently across main views (chat + settings) without unintended translucency.
- **Startup Session Restore**: Fix restored sessions appearing selected but not opening until reselecting the folder (defer history load until the sidecar is running; allow re-clicking the selected session to reload).

### Changed

- **Packs UI**: Style runtime requirement pills consistently.

## [0.2.13] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **Skill Templates: New Starter Skills**: Add two new bundled starter skills: `brainstorming` and `development-estimation`.
- **Skill Templates: Runtime Pills**: Starter skill cards now show optional runtime hints (e.g. Python/Node/Bash) via `requires: [...]` YAML frontmatter.
- **Skills UI: Installed Skill Discoverability**: Add clearer install/manage UX (runtime note, counts for folder vs global installs, and a jump-to-installed action).

### Fixed

- **Dev Skill Template Discovery**: In `tauri dev`, load starter skill templates from `src-tauri/resources/skill-templates/` so newly added templates appear immediately (avoids stale `target/**/resources/**` copies).
- **Logs Viewer UX**: Improve log viewer usability (fullscreen mode, and copy feedback).
- **Skill Template Parsing**: Fix invalid bundled skill template frontmatter (missing `name`) so it is not skipped.

### Changed

- **Packs UI**: Show packs only (remove starter skills section) and move the runtime note to the top of the Packs page.
- **Docs**: Expand contributor documentation with a developer guide for adding skills.

## [0.2.12] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- **Orchestrator Model Routing**: Persist the selected provider/model on orchestrator runs and prefer it when sending prompts so runs don't start with an "unknown" model or send messages without an explicit model spec.
- **Orchestrator Restart/Retries**: Prevent "restart" from instantly reporting success without doing any work (guard against empty plans; allow restarting completed runs to rerun the full plan).
- **Logs Viewer Copy/Scroll**: Make long log lines easy to inspect and share (horizontal scroll + selected-line preview + copy helpers).
- **Orchestrator Run Deletion**: Allow deleting orchestrator runs from the Sessions sidebar (removes the run from disk and deletes its backing OpenCode session).
- **Release to Discord**: Automated releases now post to Discord via the release workflow (release:published events triggered by `GITHUB_TOKEN` are not delivered to other workflows).
- **Release to Discord**: Ensure Discord notifications fire for automated releases by posting from the release workflow (instead of relying on `release: published`, which doesn't trigger when publishing via `GITHUB_TOKEN`).

## [0.2.11] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **On-Demand Logs Viewer**: Add a right-side Logs drawer that can tail Tandem app log files (from the app data `logs/` directory) and show OpenCode sidecar stdout/stderr (captured into a bounded in-memory ring buffer). Streaming only runs while the drawer is open/active to avoid baseline performance cost.
- **Poe Provider**: Add Poe as an OpenAI-compatible provider option (endpoint + `POE_API_KEY`). Thanks [@CamNoob](https://github.com/CamNoob).

### Fixed

- **OpenCode Session Hangs**: Prevent sessions from getting stuck indefinitely when a tool invocation never reaches a terminal state by recognizing more terminal tool statuses, ignoring heartbeat/diff noise in the stream, and fail-fast cancelling with a surfaced error after a timeout.
- **Sidecar StdIO Deadlock Risk**: Always drain the OpenCode sidecar stdout/stderr pipes so the sidecar cannot block if it emits high-volume output.
- **Log Noise Reduction**: Ignore OpenCode `server.*` heartbeat SSE events (and downgrade other unknown SSE events) to prevent log spam during long-running sessions.
- **Vault Locked Log Spam**: Avoid warning-level logs when the keystore isn't available because the vault is locked (expected state).
- **Release Pipeline Resilience**: Retry GitHub Release asset uploads to reduce flakes during transient GitHub errors.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-02-09 (Failed Release)

- Release attempt failed due to GitHub release asset upload errors during a GitHub incident; no assets were published. v0.2.11 re-cuts the same changes.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **Project File Indexing**: Add an incremental, per-project file index for workspace embeddings with total/percent progress reporting.
- **Memory Stats Scope**: Switch Vector Database Stats between All Projects and Active Project views.
- **Auto-Index Toggle**: Optionally auto-index the active project on load (with a short cooldown).
- **Clear File Index**: Clear only file-derived vectors/chunks for a project (optional VACUUM) to reclaim space.

### Fixed

- **Question Prompts**: Properly handle OpenCode `question.asked` events (including multi-question requests) and render an interactive one-at-a-time wizard with multiple-choice + custom answers; replies are sent via the OpenCode `/question/{requestID}/reply` API.
- **Startup Session History**: When restoring the last active project on launch, automatically load its sessions by scoping OpenCode `/session` and `/project` listing calls to the active workspace directory.
- **Windows Dev Reload Sidecar Cleanup**: Prevent orphaned OpenCode sidecar (and Bun) processes when the app is restarted during `tauri dev` rebuilds by attaching the sidecar to a Windows Job Object (kill-on-close).

## [0.2.8] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **Multi Custom Providers (OpenCode)**: Support selecting any provider from the OpenCode sidecar catalog (including user-defined providers by name in `.opencode/config.json`), not just the built-in set.

### Fixed

- **Model Selection Routing**: Persist the selected `provider_id` + `model_id` and prefer it when sending messages, so switching to non-standard providers actually takes effect.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- **OpenCode Config Safety**: Prevent OpenCode config writes from deleting an existing `opencode.json` when replacement fails (e.g. file locked on Windows).
- **Sidecar Idle Memory**: Set Bun/JSC memory env hints to reduce excessive idle memory usage.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- **macOS Release Builds**: Disabled codesigning/notarization by default in the release workflow to prevent macOS builds from failing when Apple certificate secrets are missing or misconfigured. (Enable with `MACOS_SIGNING_ENABLED=true` repo variable.)

## [0.2.5] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- **Release Build Trigger**: Bumped version/tag to ensure GitHub Releases builds run with the corrected workflow configuration.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **Vector DB Stats (Settings)**: Added a Memory section in Settings to view vector database stats and manually index the current workspace.
- **macOS Release Verification**: Release/CI now includes Gatekeeper checks (`codesign`, `spctl`, `stapler validate`) for produced DMGs (informational unless Apple signing secrets are configured).

### Fixed

- **Starter Pack Installs (Windows/macOS/Linux)**: Fixed pack/template resolution in packaged builds so Starter Packs and Starter Skills can be installed correctly from bundled resources.
- **Onboarding For Custom Providers**: Custom providers (e.g. LM Studio / OpenAI-compatible endpoints) are now treated as “configured”, preventing onboarding from forcing users back to Settings.
- **Pack Install Errors**: Pack install failures now surface the underlying error message in the UI.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- **Orchestration Session Spam**: Orchestration no longer creates endless new root chat sessions during execution.
  - Sub-agent/task sessions are now created as child sessions (so they don't flood the main session list).
  - Session listing now prefers root sessions only, with a fallback for older sidecars.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **Knowledge Work Skills Migration**: Completed the migration of all legacy knowledge work skills to the Tandem format.
  - **Productivity Pack**: `productivity-memory`, `productivity-tasks`, `productivity-start`, `productivity-update`, `inbox-triage`, `meeting-notes`, `research-synthesis`, `writing-polish`.
  - **Sales Pack**: `sales-account-research`, `sales-call-prep`, `sales-competitive-intelligence`, `sales-create-asset`, `sales-daily-briefing`, `sales-draft-outreach`.
  - **Bio-Informatics Pack**: `bio-instrument-data`, `bio-nextflow-manager`, `bio-research-strategy`, `bio-single-cell`, `bio-strategy`.
  - **Data Science Pack**: `data-analyze`, `data-build-dashboard`, `data-create-viz`, `data-explore-data`, `data-validate`, `data-write-query`.
  - **Enterprise Knowledge Pack**: `enterprise-knowledge-synthesis`, `enterprise-search-knowledge`, `enterprise-search-source`, `enterprise-search-strategy`, `enterprise-source-management`.
  - **Finance Pack**: `finance-income-statement`, `finance-journal-entry`, `finance-reconciliation`, `finance-sox-testing`, `finance-variance-analysis`.
  - **Legal Pack**: `legal-canned-responses`, `legal-compliance`, `legal-contract-review`, `legal-meeting-briefing`, `legal-nda-triage`, `legal-risk-assessment`.
  - **Marketing Pack**: `marketing-brand-voice`, `marketing-campaign-planning`, `marketing-competitive-analysis`, `marketing-content-creation`, `marketing-performance-analytics`.
  - **Product Pack**: `product-competitive-analysis`, `product-feature-spec`, `product-metrics`, `product-roadmap`, `product-stakeholder-comms`, `product-user-research`.
  - **Support Pack**: `support-customer-research`, `support-escalation`, `support-knowledge-management`, `support-response-drafting`, `support-ticket-triage`.
  - **Design & Frontend Pack**: `canvas-design`, `theme-factory`, `frontend-design`, `web-artifacts-builder`, `algorithmic-art`.
  - **Internal Comms**: `internal-comms`.
  - **Utilities**: `cowork-mcp-config-assistant`.
- **Skill Templates**: All migrated skills are now available as offline-compatible templates in the `src-tauri/resources/skill-templates` directory.
- **Brand Neutralization**: All skills have been updated to be model-agnostic, removing dependencies on specific AI providers.
- **Extensions**: New top-level Extensions area with tabs for Skills, Plugins, and Integrations (MCP).
- **MCP Integrations UI**: Add/remove remote HTTP and local stdio MCP servers with scope support (Global vs Folder).
- **MCP Presets**: Added popular remote presets (including Context7 and DeepWiki) for quick setup.
- **Skills Search**: Added a search box to filter both Starter skills and Installed skills.
- **New Skill Template**: `youtube-scriptwriter` starter skill template.

### Improved

- **MCP Test Connection**: Test now performs a protocol-correct MCP `initialize` POST and validates JSON-RPC (including SSE responses) instead of using HEAD/GET.
- **MCP Status UX**: More accurate status mapping and actionable error messages (auth required, wrong URL, incompatible transport, deprecated endpoint).

### Fixed

- MCP connection tests no longer report "Connected" for non-2xx HTTP responses like 405/410.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **Guided onboarding wizard** to drive a first outcome (choose folder → connect AI → run starter workflow).
- **Starter Packs**: bundled, offline workflow packs you can install into a folder from inside the app.
- **Starter Skills gallery**: bundled, offline skill templates with an “Advanced: paste SKILL.md” option retained.
- **Contributor hygiene**: GitHub issue/PR templates and new product/architecture docs at repo root.

### Improved

- **Orchestration reliability**:
  - Increased default budgets (iterations/sub-agent runs) and auto-upgraded legacy runs with too-low limits.
  - Provider rate-limit/quota errors now **pause** runs (instead of burning retries) so you can switch model/provider and resume.
- **Provider switching**: fixed stale env var propagation by explicitly syncing/removing provider API key env vars and restarting sidecar when provider toggles change.
- **CI confidence**: frontend lint now fails the build instead of being ignored.

### Fixed

- Orchestrator could “explode” sub-agent runs due to tasks not being marked finished on error (leading to endless requeue/recovery loops).
- Model/provider could not be changed after a run failed; model selection is now available to recover and resume.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Introduced a major new mode for complex task execution.
  - **Task DAG**: Supports dependency-aware task graphs (Planner -> Builder -> Validator).
  - **Sub-Agents**: Orchestrates specialized agents for planning, coding, and verifying.
  - **Cost & Safety**: Implements strict budget controls (tokens, time, iterations) and policy-based tool gating.
  - **Visualize**: New Kanban board and budget meter to track progress in real-time.
- **Unified Session Sidebar**: Completely redesigned the sidebar to merge chat sessions and orchestrator runs into a single, cohesive chronological list.
  - **Project Grouping**: Items are smartly grouped by project with sticky headers.
  - **Status Indicators**: Orchestrator runs show live status (Running, Completed, Failed).

## [0.1.15] - 2026-02-03

### Added

- **Unified Update UI**: Replaced the disparate update experiences for OpenCode (Sidecar) and Tandem (App) with a single, polished, full-screen overlay component.
- **Conflict Resolution**: The new `AppUpdateOverlay` takes precedence over other update screens, ensuring that app updates (which restart the application) are handled cleanly and avoid conflicts with sidecar updates.

## [0.1.14] - 2026-01-31

### Improved

- **Ralph Loop Reliability**: Updated the prompt engineering for both Ralph Loop and Plan Execution modes to explicitly enforce the use of the `todowrite` tool. This ensures that tasks are visually marked as "completed" in the UI as the AI finishes them, preventing the state desync where work was done but tasks remained unchecked.
- **Task Execution Flow**: When executing approved tasks from the Plan sidebar, the system now provides stronger directives to the AI to update task status immediately upon completion.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- **Ralph Loop**: Implemented iterative task execution mode with the following features:
  - New `ralph` Rust module with `RalphLoopManager`, `RalphStorage`, and `RalphRunHandle`
  - Toggle button in chat control bar to enable/disable loop mode
  - Status chip showing current iteration and status (Running/Paused/Completed/Error)
  - Side panel with pause/resume/cancel controls and context injection
  - Completion detection via `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` token matching
  - Struggle detection after 3 iterations with no file changes or repeated errors
  - Git-based file change tracking between iterations
  - Workspace-local storage at `.opencode/tandem/ralph/` (state.json, history.json, context.md)
  - Seven Tauri commands: `ralph_start`, `ralph_cancel`, `ralph_pause`, `ralph_resume`, `ralph_add_context`, `ralph_status`, `ralph_history`
  - Plan Mode integration - Ralph respects staging and never auto-executes
  - Frontend components: `LoopToggle`, `LoopStatusChip`, `RalphPanel`
- **Memory Context System**: Integrated a semantic memory store using `sqlite-vec`. This allows the AI to store and retrieve context from past sessions and project documentation, enabling long-term memory and smarter context-aware responses.

### Fixed

- **Memory Store Initialization**: Resolved an `unresolved import sqlite_vec::sqlite_vec` error by correctly implementing the `sqlite3_vec_init` C-extension registration via `rusqlite`.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- **Planning Mode**: Introduced a dedicated planning agent that generates comprehensive markdown-based implementation plans before executing code changes. Includes support for real-time plan file synchronization and a specialized UI for plan management.
- **Plan File Watcher**: Backend file watcher for `.opencode/plans/` that automatically updates the UI when plans are modified, ensuring the frontend is always in sync with the AI's latest proposals.
- **Ask Follow-up Question**: Integrated support for the `ask_followup_question` tool in the planning process, allowing the AI to clarify scope and technical preferences with interactive suggestion buttons.

### Fixed

- **Backend Compilation**: Resolved a critical "no method named `get_workspace_path` found" error in `commands.rs` by adding the missing method to `AppState`.
- **Tool Parsing Accuracy**: Improved sidecar communication by strictly enforcing tool name formatting (removing potential leading spaces) and correcting invalid tool examples in the plan skill instructions.

### Changed

- **Planning Flow**: Streamlined the transition from plan to execution. The AI is now instructed to generate plans immediately without conversational filler, using strict system directives.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed

- **File Viewer**: Fixed "Failed to load directory" error by removing overly restrictive path allowlist checks that were causing Windows path normalization issues.
- **Permission Spam**: Prevented repeated approval prompts for the same tool request.
- **Allow All Auto-Approval**: Aligned auto-approval with permission request IDs to stop duplicate prompts.
- **Session Switching**: Cleared pending permission state when switching sessions to avoid stale approvals.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed

- **Version Metadata**: Fixed version numbers in `tauri.conf.json`, `package.json`, and `Cargo.toml` to ensure proper auto-update detection. Previous release (v0.1.10) had mismatched version metadata (some files were 0.1.8 or 0.1.9 while the built version was 0.1.10), causing update failures.
- **File Access Guardrails**: Enforced workspace allowlist checks for file browsing, text reads, and binary reads to prevent unintended access outside the active workspace.
- **Windows Path Denylist**: Normalized Windows path separators so deny patterns like `.env` and key files reliably block access.
- **Binary Read Limits**: Added size limits for binary reads to avoid large base64 payloads.
- **Log Noise**: Removed verbose streaming and provider debug logs to reduce UI overhead during active sessions.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-01-22

### Added

- **Skills Management UI**: Added a complete skills management interface in Settings, allowing users to import, view, and manage OpenCode-compatible skills (both project-specific and global).
- **Skill Discovery**: Implemented automatic discovery of installed skills from both project (`.opencode/skill/`) and global (`~/.config/opencode/skills/`) directories.
- **Smart Project Selection**: Skills panel now displays the active project name and automatically disables project-specific installation when no project is selected.
- **Skill Resource Links**: Added clickable links to popular skill repositories (open skills library, SkillHub, GitHub) using Tauri's native URL opener.
- **Automatic Sidecar Restart**: Implemented seamless AI engine restart after skill import with a full-screen overlay matching the app's aesthetic. Features animated rotating icon, pulsing progress bars, and backdrop blur.

### Fixed

- **Skills Import Reliability**: Fixed critical bug where SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter containing colons (e.g., "for: (1)") would fail to parse. The parser now automatically quotes descriptions with special characters.
- **Skills Save Format**: Fixed issue where imported skills were being reconstructed incorrectly, causing frontmatter corruption. Skills are now saved with their original content preserved.
- **TypeScript Errors**: Resolved missing `projectPath` prop type in SkillsPanel component.
- **External Links**: Fixed broken external links in Skills panel to use Tauri's `openUrl()` instead of non-functional `href` attributes.

### Changed

- **Button Styling**: Cleaned up Save button appearance by removing emoji for a more professional look.
- **Project Name Display**: Improved visual hierarchy in project selection with bold primary-colored project names and muted path indicators.
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive debug logging for skill discovery and YAML parsing to improve troubleshooting.
- **Auto-Refresh**: Skills list now properly refreshes after importing new skills by awaiting the refresh callback.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed

- **macOS Styling:** Refined the glass effect styling and other UI polish to improve the overall look and feel on macOS.
- **BaseHref Support:** Added support for `baseHref` in HTML previews to correctly resolve relative paths for images and stylesheets.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed

- **Slides Workflow Feedback Loop:** Refined the presentation guidance to be more flexible, ensuring the AI acknowledges user feedback/improvements during the planning phase instead of jumping immediately to execution.
- **"Add to Chat" Reliability:** Fixed a state management bug in `ChatInput` that prevented HTML files and other external attachments from being correctly added to the chat context.
- **Blur Obstruction:** Removed the `blur(6px)` transition from the `Message` component and streaming indicator, preventing the chat from becoming unreadable during active AI generation.
- **High-Fidelity PDF Export:** Added `@page { margin: 0; size: landscape; }` and `color-adjust` CSS to the HTML slide template to suppress browser headers/footers and preserve professional aesthetics during PDF export.
- **File Link Detection (Chat UI):** Refined the file path detection regex to only match explicit paths (containing slashes or drive letters), preventing normal text from being incorrectly rendered as "jarbled" clickable links.
- **Dynamic Ollama Discovery:** Implemented automatic model discovery for local Ollama instances. The application now dynamically generates the sidecar configuration based on actually installed local models, ensuring a seamless zero-config experience across all platforms.
- **Cross-Platform Config Reliability:** Updated the sidecar manager to correctly handle OpenCode configuration paths on Linux, macOS, and Windows, and bundled a default template in the installer for improved auto-update reliability.
- **Settings Synchronization:** Fixed a bug where changing the model/provider in settings was not immediately reflected in the Chat interface.
- **Model Selector Refinement:** Cleaned up the model dropdown to prioritize OpenCode Zen/Ollama and hide unconfigured providers, reducing clutter.
- **"Allow All" Logic:** Fixed a critical issue where the "Allow All" toggle was ignored by the event handler, implementing robust auto-approval logic for permissions.
- **Chat History Visibility:** Improved session list filtering to strictly handle project path normalization, ensuring only relevant project chats are shown while preventing history loss.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-01-20

### Added

- **High-Fidelity HTML Slides:** Replaced legacy PPTX generation with an interactive 16:9 HTML slideshow system featuring Chart.js integration, keyboard navigation, optimized PDF export via a dedicated Print button, content overflow protection, and strict density limits (max 6 items per slide).
- **Collapsible Tool Outputs:** Large tool outputs (like `todowrite` or file operations) are now collapsed by default in the chat view, reducing visual noise. Users can expand them to see full details.
- **Chart Generation Capabilities:** Updated internal marketing documentation to highlight the new capability of generating interactive visual dashboards directly from research data.
- HTML Canvas/Report feature: render interactive HTML files in a sandboxed iframe with Tailwind, Chart.js, and Font Awesome support.
- "Research" tool category with dedicated instructions for a robust "Search → Select → Fetch" workflow.
- Visibility of AI reasoning/thinking parts in both live streaming and chat history.
- Automatic persistence of the current active session across reloads/refreshes.
- Default "allow" rules for safe tools (`ls`, `read`, `todowrite`, `websearch`, `webfetch`) to reduce permission prompts.

### Fixed

- **[REDACTED] Filtering:** Removed spurious `[REDACTED]` markers that were leaking from OpenCode's internal reasoning output into the chat UI.
- **File Link Detection (Critical Fix):** Completely rewrote the file path regex to reliably detect Unix absolute paths like `/home/user/file.html` in chat messages, making them clickable.
- **Slide Layout & Scaling:** Fixed vertical stacking of slides in the HTML generator and added auto-scaling to fit the viewer's viewport dimensions.
- **Chat Error Handling:** Implemented deduplication for session error messages to prevent repeated bubbles during stream failures.
- **Linux UI Transparency:** Fixed an issue where the project switcher dropdown was unreadable on Linux due to incorrect glass effect rendering.
- **Session Loading:** Resolved a bug where the application would start with a blank screen instead of loading the previously selected chat session.
- **External Link Handling:** Fixed permission issues preventing "Open in Browser" from working for generated files.
- **HTML Preview:** Links within generated HTML reports now correctly open in the system default browser.
- **Tool Selector Cleanup:** Temporarily disabled the unimplemented "Diagrams" and "Tables" categories from the specialized tools selector to improve UX.
- Robust cancellation: Stop button now reliably terminates backend AI processes using a fallback API mechanism.
- Tool visibility: All tool calls (including technical ones) are now visible throughout the session per user request.
- Fixed chat "freezing" by ensuring intermediate reasoning and tool steps are always streamed to the UI.
- Replaced hardcoded version numbers with dynamic values in `MatrixLoader`, `Settings`, and the initial splash screen.
- Improved error handling in the sidecar manager when primary cancellation endpoints are unavailable.
- Resolved ESLint warnings in `Message.tsx` and `Chat.tsx`.

### Changed

- Updated `create_session` and `rewind_to_message` to include default safe-tool permissions.
- Modified `sidecar.rs` to treat "reasoning" parts as visible content.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-20

### Added

- Compact theme selector dropdown with theme details and color swatches.
- Active provider/model badge next to the tool selector in chat.
- Allow-all toggle for tool permissions on new chats.

### Fixed

- Linux `.deb` auto-update now downloads the `.deb` artifact (instead of the AppImage), preventing `update is not a valid deb package`.
- Taskbar no longer overlays the About and Settings screens.
- OpenCode sidecar API compatibility after upstream route changes (provider/model listing and prompt submission).
- Streaming event parsing for newer OpenCode SSE payload shapes.
- Structured provider errors now surface in the chat UI instead of failing silently; improved extraction of specific reasons (e.g., credit limits) from nested responses.
- Permission prompts now render correctly for updated tool event payloads.
- Provider key status refreshes immediately after saving or deleting API keys.
- Technical tool calls (edit, write, ls, etc.) are now handled as transient background tasks and auto-cleanup from chat on success.
- Final AI responses now render reliably at the end of a session, with an automatic backfill mechanism if the stream is interrupted.
- Reduced terminal log spam by downgrading verbose background activity and summarizing large event payloads.
- Fixed a TypeScript error where the `tool` property was missing from the `tool_end` event payload.

### Changed

- Update checking and install progress is now shown at the top of Settings.
