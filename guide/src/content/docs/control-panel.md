title: Control Panel (Web Admin)
description: Run the official Tandem web control panel or scaffold an editable app from npm.
---

Use the control panel when you want a browser UI for chat, orchestrator, automations, memory, live feed, packs, and runtime ops.

The canonical operator flow now starts from `@frumu/tandem` and its master
`tandem` CLI. The panel is an add-on that you install when you want the web UI.

## Choose a path

### Official ready-to-run package

Use this when you want the supported packaged control panel with bootstrap and service helpers.

```bash
npm i -g @frumu/tandem
tandem install panel
tandem panel init
```

### Editable app scaffold

Use this when you want the actual app source in your own folder so you can customize routes, pages, themes, styles, and runtime behavior.

```bash
npm create tandem-panel@latest my-panel
cd my-panel
npm install
npm run dev
```

The generated app includes editable `src/`, `server/`, local runtime scripts, and local config files.

## Official package: initialize environment

```bash
tandem panel init
```

This creates/updates `.env` and ensures an engine token is available.

## Official package: run

```bash
tandem panel open
```

Open:

- `http://127.0.0.1:39732`

Aliases:

- `tandem`
- `tandem-setup`
- `tandem-control-panel`
- `tandem-control-panel-init` (init only)

## Official package: optional service install (Linux)

```bash
sudo tandem service install
```

Useful options:

- `--service-mode=both|engine|panel` (default `both`)
- `--service-user=<linux-user>`

## Editable scaffold: customize

After scaffolding:

- edit `src/pages/` and `src/app/` for routes and views
- edit `src/app/themeContract.ts` and `src/app/themes.js` for themes
- edit `server/` and `bin/setup.js` for runtime behavior
- run `npm run build` for a production bundle
- run `npm run start` to serve the built app locally

## Core Environment Variables

- `TANDEM_CONTROL_PANEL_PORT` (default `39732`)
- `TANDEM_ENGINE_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:39731`)
- `TANDEM_CONTROL_PANEL_AUTO_START_ENGINE` (`1` or `0`)
- `TANDEM_CONTROL_PANEL_ENGINE_TOKEN` (engine API token)
- `TANDEM_SEARCH_BACKEND` (`tandem`, `brave`, `exa`, `searxng`, or `none`)
- `TANDEM_SEARCH_URL` (default hosted Tandem search endpoint for official installs)
- `TANDEM_BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` / `TANDEM_EXA_API_KEY` (optional direct-provider overrides in `engine.env`)

## Automations + Cost (Dashboard)

The main dashboard includes a first-class **Automations + Cost** section that aggregates:

- Token usage (`24h`, `7d`) from run telemetry.
- Estimated USD cost (`24h`, `7d`).
- Top automation/routine IDs by estimated cost, token volume, and run count.

This includes legacy automations/routines and advanced multi-agent automation runs.

Cost estimation uses the engine rate:

- `TANDEM_TOKEN_COST_PER_1K_USD` (USD per 1,000 tokens, default `0`).

## Control Panel Shell

The control panel now uses a shell with:

- an icon rail for primary navigation
- a context rail for system status and actions
- a main workspace with animated route transitions and page headers

The web app intentionally pushes motion a bit further than the Tauri app while keeping the same overall visual language.

## Automations Workspace (Tabbed + Wizard)

The left nav `Automations` page (`#/automations`) now uses task-focused tabs:

- `Create`
- `Calendar`
- `List`
- `Tasks`
- `Optimize`
- `Active Teams`
- `AI Composer` when the feature flag is enabled

A built-in walkthrough wizard can be launched from the page header and also auto-opens for first-time empty workspaces.

The optional composer tab is designed for prompt-first workflow authoring. It reuses the existing planner chat transport, so the UI can draft an automation, ask a clarification question, preview the resulting `automationsV2` payload, and then create or run it directly.

Enable it with `?composer=1` or `#composer=true` when the workspace has the feature flag turned on.

Legacy `#/agents` links continue to redirect for backwards compatibility.

Deep-link query state is supported on `#/automations`:

- `tab`
- `wizard`
- `flow` (`routine` or `advanced`)
- `step`
- `composer` (`1`, `true`, `on`, or `yes`)

## Studio Workflow Builder

The **Studio** page (`#/studio`) provides a template-first workflow builder for creating multi-agent workflows.

Key features:

- **Starter templates** with editable per-agent role prompts, stage/dependency editing
- **Saved Studio workflow cards** with latest run status and stability snapshots
- **Shared workspace browser** for selecting workflow root folders
- **Direct save/run flows** into `automation_v2`

Studio templates compile research-heavy workflows into explicit stages:

- `discover` — File/content discovery
- `local-source` — Local file research
- `external-research` — Web research
- `finalize` — Artifact writing

Planner previews also surface project-scoped knowledge defaults and rollout guardrails so operators can see when Tandem will reuse promoted knowledge before recomputing.

When you are authoring staged workflows or missions, use [Prompting Workflows And Missions](./prompting-workflows-and-missions/) as the recommended guide for turning human intent into reliable Tandem prompts and handoffs.

If you want the prompt-first automation builder specifically, start with [Build an Automation With the AI Assistant](./automation-composer-workflows/).

If an external agent needs to create or run those missions through the engine APIs, also use [Creating And Running Workflows And Missions](./creating-and-running-workflows-and-missions/) and [Engine Authentication For Agents](./engine-authentication-for-agents/).

For a copy-paste, proof-style runbook for this exact path, see [Automation Examples For Teams](./automation-examples-for-teams/).

Saved workflows auto-migrate to `workflow_structure_version = 2` while preserving automation IDs and original research node IDs used by downstream nodes.

## Edit Workflow Automation Dialog (Handoffs Tab)

The **Edit workflow automation** dialog (Automations page → three-dot menu → Edit) now includes a **Handoffs** tab that exposes three connected-agent fields on V2 automations:

### Handoff config

Controls the directory layout for staged handoff artifacts, relative to the automation's workspace root.

- **Auto-approve toggle** — when on (default), artifacts move directly to the approved directory; when off, they wait in the inbox for a manual review step
- **Inbox directory** — where agents write new output artifacts (default: `shared/handoffs/inbox`)
- **Approved directory** — where promoted artifacts land (default: `shared/handoffs/approved`)
- **Archived directory** — where old artifacts are retired (default: `shared/handoffs/archived`)
- **Reset** — restores all fields to system defaults

### Scope policy

Defines the filesystem sandbox for all agents in the automation. Empty = open access.

- **Readable paths** — agents may read files at or under these paths
- **Writable paths** — agents may write to these paths (should be a subset of readable)
- **Denied paths** — always blocked, takes priority over readable/writable
- **Watch paths** — paths the watch evaluator may scan; defaults to readable paths if empty
- **Clear** — removes all restrictions (reverts to open policy)

Path entries use one path per line, prefix matching relative to workspace root.

### Watch conditions

Array of filesystem conditions that the automation evaluator checks. Each condition has a `path` and a `condition` type (`any_file_present`, `modified_since_last_run`, `empty`).

See [Connected-Agent Handoffs](./connected-agent-handoffs/) for the full reference including API shapes, HTTP examples, and WorkflowEditDraft type annotations.

## Optimize Tab (AutoResearch)

The **Optimize** tab (`#/automations?tab=optimize`) provides a UI for workflow prompt/objective optimization campaigns.

Features:

- **Campaign creation** with workflow selection and artifact references
- **Campaign detail** view with experiment listing and status
- **Experiment inspection** for reviewing candidate evaluation results
- **Approve/Reject/Apply controls** for promotion workflow

Campaigns generate bounded candidate prompts, evaluate them against baseline runs, and apply approved winners back to the live workflow.

Available campaign actions:

- `queue_replay` — Queue a baseline replay run to re-establish metrics
- `generate_candidate` — Generate the next bounded candidate for evaluation
- `approve` / `reject` — Mark an experiment as approved or rejected
- `apply` — Apply an approved winner to the live workflow with drift checks and audit metadata

## Workflow Operations (Packs)

The Packs area includes workflow operations so operators can validate workflow packs without leaving the control panel.

From the workflow operations view you can:

- inspect loaded workflows and hooks
- toggle workflow hooks on or off
- run workflow validation/reload
- simulate workflow events
- run workflows directly
- stream workflow events live while testing

This UI maps to engine workflow endpoints including:

- `GET /workflows`
- `GET /workflows/{id}`
- `POST /workflows/validate`
- `POST /workflows/simulate`
- `POST /workflows/{id}/run`
- `GET /workflows/events`
- `GET /workflow-hooks`
- `PATCH /workflow-hooks/{id}`

## Orchestrator Event Streaming

The orchestrator UI supports multiplex run event streaming so multiple run timelines can stay live at once.

- prefers `GET /context/runs/events/stream` when available on the connected engine
- exposes control-panel stream health via `/api/orchestrator/events/health`
- falls back to per-run event bridging if multiplex streaming is unavailable

## Browser Diagnostics in Settings

Settings includes a Browser Diagnostics panel for operator checks.

You can use it to:

- read current readiness from `GET /browser/status`
- trigger sidecar install with `POST /browser/install`
- run an end-to-end browser check with `POST /browser/smoke-test`

This panel is for browser host diagnostics. Actual browser automation still runs through the engine tool system using tools such as `browser_open`, `browser_click`, and `browser_screenshot`.

## Verify Engine + Panel

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:39731/global/health \
  -H "X-Agent-Token: tk_your_token"
```
