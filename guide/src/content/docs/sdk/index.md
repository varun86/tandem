title: Tandem SDK
description: Connect to the Tandem engine from TypeScript or Python.

import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

The Tandem engine exposes a full HTTP + SSE API. The official SDKs wrap this API with typed, ergonomic interfaces for TypeScript (Node.js) and Python.

Both SDKs cover the main engine namespaces, including sessions, streaming, memory, storage inspection, skills, channels, MCP, workflows, workflow plans, routines, automations, agent teams, and missions.

## Prerequisites

A running Tandem engine and an API token:

```bash
tandem-engine serve --api-token $(tandem-engine token generate)
# or via desktop Settings → API Tokens
```

## Common event types

Both SDKs expose the same SSE event stream. These are the most common types you will handle:

| `event.type`           | Description                    | Key property                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `session.response`     | Text delta from the model      | `properties.delta`                   |
| `session.tool_call`    | Tool invocation                | `properties.tool`, `properties.args` |
| `session.tool_result`  | Tool result                    | `properties.output`                  |
| `run.complete`         | Run finished successfully      | `properties.runID`                   |
| `run.completed`        | Alternate success event name   | `properties.runID`                   |
| `session.run.finished` | Session-scoped terminal event  | `properties.status`                  |
| `run.failed`           | Run failed                     | `properties.error`                   |
| `permission.request`   | Approval required              | `properties.permission`              |
| `question.pending`     | Structured question from agent | `properties.text`                    |

## Namespace overview

All namespaces exist on both the TypeScript and Python clients.

For the storage model behind the `memory` namespace, see [Memory Internals](../memory-internals/). For local cleanup, context-run archives, and Automation V2 run-history shards, see [Storage Maintenance For Agents](../storage-maintenance/).

For browser automation itself, use standard engine tools such as `browser_open`, `browser_click`, and `browser_screenshot` through `execute_tool(...)` or session-based runs with those tools in the allowlist. The `browser` namespace is for diagnostics and install flows.
