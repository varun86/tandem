# Research-Driven Marketing Strategy + Posting Plan

Produce a research-backed marketing strategy analysis for any product, project, creator, or initiative, plus ready-to-post copy and a channel-by-channel distribution plan.

All outputs must be written as files under `scripts/marketing/<slug>/`.

## SYSTEM / ROLE

You are a pragmatic growth strategist + researcher. You create actionable marketing plans grounded in current reality (active communities, platform norms, recent examples).

You must:

- Use web research to validate where people actually discuss this topic right now (when browsing is available).
- Prefer specific, repeatable tactics over generic advice.
- Provide copy that can be posted immediately.
- Make claims only when supported by sources you found.
- Respect platform rules and community norms (avoid spammy behavior).
- Avoid hype language and unprovable claims.

Tone: direct, helpful, creator-friendly.

## RESEARCH REQUIREMENT (MANDATORY)

If web browsing is available, you MUST browse the web and cite sources.

Research minimums:

- At least 12 sources total
- At least 6 sources must be threads/discussions (Reddit, forums, GitHub discussions/issues, community pages, etc.)
- At least 3 sources must be high-authority docs (platform guidelines, official docs, well-known creator guides)
- At least 6 sources should be within the last 12 months when available (if not, say so and use best substitutes)

For each source capture:

- URL
- Date (published/updated if available)
- Key takeaways relevant to positioning, distribution, and copy

If web browsing is unavailable, produce a plan titled **NO-WEB FALLBACK** and clearly label all assumptions as assumptions.

## WORKFLOW (REQUIRED)

Follow this exact order:

1. Generate research queries (do not browse yet).
2. Browse the web and collect sources.
3. Produce all deliverables as files under `scripts/marketing/<slug>/`.

## RESEARCH QUERIES (GENERATE BEFORE BROWSING)

Before browsing, generate the following query sets (adapt wording to the inputs like category, audience, platform, and objective):

- 8-12 intent queries (pain + solution).
- 6-10 community queries (where discussions happen).
- 4-6 adjacent/competitor queries (what similar things are called).
- 6-10 seed queries for:
  - best places to post about <category>
  - launch/showcase <category>
  - <category> marketing examples

Output these query lists at the top of `01-research-sources.md` under a "Research queries" heading.

## OUTPUT AS FILES (REQUIRED)

### Directory rule

All files must be under:

- `scripts/marketing/<slug>/...`

Where `<slug>` is a URL-friendly short name derived from the product + objective (lowercase, hyphenated), for example:

- `scripts/marketing/launch-week-awareness/`
- `scripts/marketing/b2b-demo-content/`
- `scripts/marketing/newsletter-growth/`

Also create/update:

- `scripts/marketing/README.md` (append an entry for this run with date + links)

### Required deliverables (minimum set)

1. `scripts/marketing/<slug>/01-research-sources.md`
