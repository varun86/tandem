# Release Notes

Canonical release notes live in `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md`.

## v0.4.8 (Unreleased)

- Added a new top-level `Studio` workflow builder in the control panel
  - template-first multi-agent workflow creation with editable role prompts, stage/dependency editing, saved Studio workflows, and a shared workspace picker
  - direct save/run flows into `automation_v2`

- Workflow run debugging and recovery are much stronger
  - workflow board now gets its own row and desktop lanes can be horizontally scrolled with jump-to-active controls
  - blocked/failed runs now expose `Continue`, `Continue From Here`, `Retry`, and `Retry Workflow`
  - task details now show semantic node status, blocked reason, approval, tool telemetry, and artifact-validation results

- File-backed workflow runtime hardening
  - `automation_v2` nodes now use deterministic required tool sets
  - workflow tool normalization now gives `read` workflows `glob` for discovery
  - `/workspace/...` file tool paths now resolve against the real workspace root
  - blocked node outcomes now stop descendants instead of letting downstream stages fabricate blocked handoffs

- Artifact integrity protections for workflow outputs
  - placeholder/status-note overwrites no longer silently replace declared output artifacts
  - undeclared touch/status/marker files are rejected and cleaned up
  - substantive blocked artifacts remain on disk for inspection
  - when a later placeholder write overwrites a real earlier write in the same node, the engine now restores the best substantive write from session history

- Saved Studio workflow deletion finally persists across restarts
  - deleting an `automation_v2` workflow now also deletes its stored run history so old run snapshots cannot recreate deleted workflows on engine boot

- Control-panel repo-source docs were corrected
  - README service/init commands now show the right paths both from the repo root and from inside `packages/tandem-control-panel`

## v0.4.7 (Released)

- Channel memory now works end-to-end across fresh Telegram/Discord/Slack sessions
  - fresh channel sessions now get `memory_search`, `memory_store`, and `memory_list` by default instead of stalling on permission requests
  - completed channel replies archive exact user-visible user/assistant exchanges into global retrieval memory while keeping the full transcript in session storage
  - archived exchanges dedupe by session/message provenance so retries do not create duplicate global rows forever
  - slash commands and `ENGINE_ERROR:` assistant replies are excluded from archival so recall stays focused on real conversation history
  - fresh `/new` channel sessions can now recall prior archived exchanges from global memory on the standard Tandem storage layout

- Channel slash commands now expose workflow planning directly in chat
  - `/help` now shows grouped command categories and `/help schedule` explains workflow-planning commands
  - added `/schedule plan`, `/schedule show`, `/schedule edit`, `/schedule reset`, and `/schedule apply` for in-channel workflow drafting and automation creation
  - `/schedule` now acts as a discoverable guided entry point for automation setup instead of requiring users to know the workflow-plan API
  - the dispatcher forwards the active session workspace root to the workflow planner when available so drafts target the correct repo/project by default
  - added namespaced operator commands for `/automations`, `/runs`, `/memory`, `/workspace`, `/mcp`, `/packs`, and `/config`
  - added topic help via `/help automations`, `/help runs`, `/help memory`, `/help workspace`, `/help mcp`, `/help packs`, and `/help config`
  - destructive channel commands now require explicit `--yes`, while list/show/search/control commands execute directly

- Memory safety and reliability fixes
  - hardened memory tools so public tool calls can no longer override the memory DB path with arbitrary `db_path` values
  - fixed `memory_list tier=global` decoding against `global_memory_chunks`, including the broken `token_count` column/index path
  - fixed channel archival to write to the same memory DB path that `memory_search` and `memory_list` read from
  - added regression coverage for DB-path resolution, global row decoding, and deduped `chat_exchange` archival

- Storage root standardization
  - standard installs now treat `TANDEM_STATE_DIR` as the canonical Tandem storage root for memory, config, logs, and session storage
  - shared-path resolution now falls back to `TANDEM_STATE_DIR` before OS defaults, preventing split installs where `memory.sqlite` lands in a second directory
  - setup helpers and example env files no longer write `TANDEM_MEMORY_DB_PATH` by default; it remains an advanced override only
  - engine startup now warns when `TANDEM_STATE_DIR` and `TANDEM_MEMORY_DB_PATH` are split, making storage drift easier to diagnose

## v0.4.6 (Released)

- Advanced Swarm Builder for coordinated multi-agent missions
  - Added a new advanced mission builder on top of `AutomationV2Spec` for orchestrated swarm-style workloads instead of only the simple workflow wizard.
  - Added mission blueprints with mission goal, shared context, workstreams, dependencies, output contracts, review stages, approval gates, and reusable per-role agent/model selection.
  - Added project-management semantics for advanced missions, including phases, lanes, priorities, milestones, and gate metadata.
  - Added compile preview, validation warnings, graph summaries, and stronger grouped dependency visualization for advanced missions.

- Web control-panel parity for advanced mission creation
  - Added a native control-panel advanced builder so the browser `/automations` surface can create and edit advanced mission automations alongside the desktop app.
  - Added a how-it-works modal, inline field guidance, and AI/workflow/agentic starter mission presets in the web UI.
  - Moved starter presets out of the TSX component into external preset files for easier review and reuse.
  - Clarified current preset scope: mission-builder starter presets are still a local bundled shelf for validation, while persisted workspace-backed template storage already exists for agent-team templates.

- Desktop Coder workspace for coding swarms
  - Turned the desktop `Developer` destination into `Coder` and made it the visible home for coding-swarm creation and operations.
  - Added a dedicated Coder workspace with `Create` and `Runs` tabs instead of a legacy run-inspector-only screen.
  - Embedded coding-swarm creation in Coder on top of the existing advanced mission builder and mission compile/apply flow, rather than creating a second orchestration system.
  - Added coding presets, user-repo context detection, and a lightweight local saved-template shelf in the Coder create flow.
  - Added automation-backed Coder run projection so coder-tagged Automation V2 runs show up directly in the Coder run list.
  - Added operator tabs for coder runs covering overview, transcripts, context, artifacts, and memory, plus direct cross-links into Agent Automation and Command Center.

- Automation V2 recovery, observability, and execution hardening
  - Added clearer stop/pause/recover semantics, branch-local repair and rework handling, richer per-step diagnostics, and milestone promotion history for advanced automation runs.
  - Fixed advanced-builder schedule payloads to use the tagged `misfire_policy` shape expected by the server.
  - Fixed external mission preset loading in the control panel.
  - Fixed an engine panic during malformed automation node execution and converted node panics into normal run failures so stuck runs surface truthfully.
  - Fixed Telegram/Slack/Discord bots failing to reply after saving channel settings with a blank Allowed Users field by normalizing empty allowlists to wildcard `["*"]`.

- Coder and automation integration cleanup
  - Added typed coder metadata so coder-originated missions stay on the existing `MissionBlueprint` and `AutomationV2` contracts.
  - Switched the desktop Coder run detail path to consume explicit backend-linked context run IDs instead of synthesizing them locally.
  - Added active user-repo context binding for coder missions, including detected repo root, remote slug, current branch, and default branch.
  - Extracted shared coder run list, detail, and operator controls so the Coder workspace reuses components instead of embedding whole legacy pages.

## v0.4.5 (Released 2026-03-10)

- Workflow automation editor and run debugger improvements
  - Expanded the workflow edit modal into a large editor with dedicated prompt editing for workflow step objectives.
  - Added explicit workflow tool access controls in both the creation wizard and edit modal: `All tools` or `Custom allowlist`.
  - Surfaced selected tool access in the wizard review step before deploy.
  - Improved run debugger sizing and scrolling so the workflow board can grow instead of being cut off in the modal.
  - Fixed right-rail blocker/failure card cropping and reduced lower log-panel height pressure so live workflow boards remain visible.
  - Tightened workflow prompt-editor cards by removing duplicated step text and redundant labels.
  - Made the final workflow review step easier to read by collapsing long plan/prompt text into expandable markdown previews.

- Workflow automation engine/planner integration fixes
  - Fixed workflow automation save payloads to use the server-required tagged `misfire_policy` shape.
  - Updated workflow-plan apply so new workflow automations honor `tool_access_mode` and `tool_allowlist` from operator preferences.
  - Made workflow tool access explicit instead of relying on the old hidden narrow allowlist behavior.
  - Fixed duplicate workflow automation list rows in the control panel by normalizing Automation V2 list rendering by id.
  - Hardened the engine loop so malformed tool calls get bounded inline self-repair retries before burning workflow node attempts.
  - Added targeted malformed-tool recovery guidance for empty `bash`, missing `webfetch` URL, and missing file/write arguments.

- Registry publish fix for the TypeScript client
  - Fixed `@frumu/tandem-client` publish builds by restoring missing `AgentStandupComposeInput` and `AgentStandupComposeResponse` imports.

## v0.4.4 (Released 2026-03-09)

- Official control-panel bootstrap path for headless installs
  - Added a real `tandem-setup` CLI with `init`, `doctor`, `service`, `pair mobile`, and `run`.
  - Added shared bootstrap/setup modules for canonical env paths, env creation, engine-config bootstrap, and diagnostics.
  - Added cross-platform service generation for Linux `systemd` and macOS `launchd`.
  - Added a shared `service-runner` entrypoint so managed services start through the same env-loading contract.
  - Added focused tests for bootstrap env generation, `systemd` units, `launchd` plists, and `doctor`.

- Agent standups, reusable agent personalities, and workspace memory defaults
  - Added reusable agent personalities in the control panel with persistent prompts, default models, and avatar upload.
  - Added server-side standup workflow composition on top of Automation V2 using saved agent personalities.
  - Added workspace-aware memory defaults so chats and automations can use `memory_search`, `memory_store`, and `memory_list` without manually supplying `session_id` or `project_id`.
  - Added deterministic `project_id` binding for workspace-backed sessions to improve recall across prior conversations in the same workspace.
  - Updated standup workflows to combine memory recall with workspace inspection through `glob`, `grep`, and `read`.

- Control-panel runtime/bootstrap refinements
  - Made `tandem-setup init` the documented bootstrap path while keeping legacy `tandem-control-panel --init` compatibility.
  - Switched official bootstrap to canonical OS config/data paths instead of relying on cwd `.env`.
  - Added `TANDEM_CONTROL_PANEL_HOST`, `TANDEM_CONTROL_PANEL_PUBLIC_URL`, and canonical control-panel state-dir support for future gateway/mobile pairing.
  - Updated the runtime to bind explicitly to the configured panel host and load managed env files before startup.
  - Updated package/docs/example guidance so headless installs flow through the control-panel gateway layer instead of the old quickstart bootstrap path.

- Automation V2 save reliability after storage migration
  - Fixed `WORKFLOW_PLAN_APPLY_FAILED` automation save failures caused by persistence verification treating stale legacy `automations_v2.json` migration files as authoritative.
  - Kept save verification strict on the active canonical automation file and downgraded stale fallback-file mismatches to warnings.
  - Added regression coverage for successful automation save/apply when a stale legacy automation file is still present.

## v0.4.3 (Unreleased)

- Automation V2 restart persistence is fixed.
  - Fixed an engine startup race that could overwrite saved automations with `{}` before persisted definitions were loaded.
  - Moved Automation V2 canonical storage into the Tandem global `data/` directory, with legacy root-level files kept as migration fallback on load.
  - Added persistence verification, startup diagnostics, and recovery from run snapshots when definition files are missing.

- Tandem TUI coding-agent workflow upgrades
  - Added coding-first keyboard shortcuts:
    - `Alt+P` opens workspace file search and inserts `@path` references into the active composer.
    - `Alt+D` opens a scrollable git diff overlay for reviewing local changes in-place.
    - `Alt+E` opens the active composer text in `$VISUAL` / `$EDITOR` and writes edited content back into the TUI.
  - Added matching slash commands:
    - `/files [query]`
    - `/diff`
    - `/edit`
  - Added dedicated coding workflow overlays:
    - file-search modal with keyboard navigation and quick insert
    - pager modal with line/page scrolling for long content
  - Improved tool-call and tool-result transcript rendering to show clearer multi-line execution cells during coding sessions.
  - Updated Tandem TUI docs/help surfaces with the new coding workflow keys and commands.

- Desktop orchestrator + command center stabilization
  - Fixed orchestrator resume so runs with no tasks re-enter planning instead of getting stuck trying to execute an empty plan.
  - Restored run-list visibility across mixed storage by merging context runs with legacy local orchestrator runs.
  - Hardened run deletion for context runs by removing shared `data/context_runs/<run_id>` state and surfacing real delete failures.
  - Replaced native desktop `window.confirm` prompts in orchestrator controls with in-app confirmation dialogs.
  - Added in-app toast surfacing for payment/quota failures (`payment required`, credit-limit style provider errors).
  - Tuned planner guidance so non-trivial report/objective requests avoid collapsing into a single task.
  - Reduced terminal log spam by suppressing duplicate in-flight `tool.lifecycle.start` events for the same tool part even when provider args stream updates.
  - Fixed command center action visibility so selected runs reliably expose pause/cancel/continue/delete controls.
  - Fixed validator/retry mismatch where write-intended tasks could be treated as non-writing and loop into `Max retries exceeded` with `no changed-file evidence`; retries now escalate to strict-write when validator feedback proves no workspace changes.

- Bug Monitor settings foundation and server config/status surface
  - Added persisted bug-monitor config in `tandem-server` for repo, selected MCP server, provider preference, and dedicated `model_policy.default_model` routing.
  - Added fail-closed readiness/status evaluation for selected model availability, MCP connectivity, and required GitHub capabilities.
  - Fixed the Bug Monitor settings-page initialization crash caused by early query access.
  - Changed reporter model selection to allow typed/manual model IDs with provider-backed suggestions, and fixed model persistence across reloads.
  - Generalized GitHub MCP capability readiness so arbitrary MCP server instance names can satisfy reporter issue capabilities.
  - Added reporter HTTP endpoints:
    - `GET /config/bug-monitor`

- Tandem Coder memory promotion guardrails
  - Hardened coder-side promotion rules for newer memory kinds before they enter governed memory.
  - `duplicate_linkage` promotion now requires both linked issue and linked PR numbers.
  - `regression_signal` promotion now requires structured regression entries plus supporting evidence artifacts.
  - Generic terminal `run_outcome` backfills are no longer promotable without workflow evidence artifacts.
  - PR review and merge follow-on runs now persist their own `duplicate_linkage` candidates from parent issue-fix runs instead of relying only on the original PR submit artifact.
  - Failed issue-triage reproduction now also emits `regression_signal` memory, so post-failure analysis is not limited to Bug Monitor triage.
  - Failed issue-fix validation now also emits `regression_signal` memory with the failing validation evidence.
  - Issue-fix worker-session failures now also emit rich `run_outcome` memory with worker artifact and session context.
  - Issue-triage, PR-review, and merge-recommendation worker-session failures now also emit rich `run_outcome` memory with worker artifact and session context.
  - Issue-fix retrieval now prioritizes `regression_signal` memory so failed validation history can influence later fixes across related issues.
    - `PATCH /config/bug-monitor`
    - `GET /bug-monitor/status`
    - `GET /bug-monitor/drafts`
    - `GET /bug-monitor/drafts/{id}`
  - Control-panel Settings now has a dedicated `Bug Monitor` tab with repo/MCP/provider/model selection, readiness indicators, and recent draft visibility.
  - Added `#/bug-monitor` as the canonical route for direct access to the Bug Monitor settings surface.
  - Desktop Settings now has a matching engine-backed `Bug Monitor` card with MCP deep-linking and recent draft visibility.
  - Added a Tauri bridge for reporter config, status, draft listing, draft lookup, and manual draft submission.
  - Added `POST /bug-monitor/report` so desktop logs and failed orchestrator runs can create deduped local issue drafts through the engine.
  - Fixed the desktop sidecar reporter config path to use the canonical `GET/PATCH /config/bug-monitor` route.
  - Added engine-backed draft approval/deny actions at `POST /bug-monitor/drafts/{id}/approve` and `POST /bug-monitor/drafts/{id}/deny`, and surfaced those actions in desktop Settings.
  - Control-panel Settings now uses those same draft approval endpoints, keeping Bug Monitor decisions consistent across desktop and web surfaces.
  - Added `POST /bug-monitor/drafts/{id}/triage-run`, which promotes an approved draft into a minimal engine-owned `bug_monitor_triage` context run with seeded inspection and validation tasks.
  - Desktop and control-panel Settings can now create those triage runs directly from approved Bug Monitor drafts.
  - Control-panel Dashboard now includes those `bug_monitor_triage` context runs in the existing context-run visibility drawer.
  - Added `POST /bug-monitor/drafts/{id}/issue-draft`, which renders a template-aware issue draft artifact from the repo bug template before GitHub publish.
  - Bug Monitor GitHub publish now uses that rendered issue-draft artifact instead of opening issues directly from raw incident details.
  - Auto-publish now defers with `triage_pending` until a triage-backed issue draft exists, preventing premature low-signal issue creation.
  - Fixed Bug Monitor incident persistence so draft-creation failures leave a visible incident error instead of a half-created tracker row.
  - Approving a Bug Monitor draft no longer fails the operator action just because the follow-up GitHub publish step is blocked.
  - Split Bug Monitor readiness into local ingest vs GitHub publish readiness so live tracker surfaces can show “watching locally” when incident capture is healthy but GitHub posting is blocked.
  - Added `POST /bug-monitor/drafts/{id}/triage-summary` so Bug Monitor triage can persist a structured summary artifact for issue drafting.
  - Bug Monitor issue-draft generation now prefers that structured triage summary over raw incident detail when rendering the repo issue template.
  - Bug Monitor now suppresses duplicate incidents earlier in both runtime ingest and manual `POST /bug-monitor/report` flows by consulting stored `failure_pattern` memory before opening a fresh draft.
  - Bug Monitor incidents now persist a compact duplicate summary when suppression happens so tracker UIs can explain duplicate suppression after reload/reconnect without overloading the raw source-event payload.
  - Bug Monitor triage summaries now persist governed `failure_pattern` memory for subject `bug_monitor`, so structured triage can suppress later matching reports even without a prior coder-run artifact.
  - Approving a Bug Monitor draft without triage now also persists governed `failure_pattern` memory from the approved draft itself, so operator-approved issues still teach duplicate suppression.
  - `failure_pattern` memory now carries recurrence metadata and stronger issue-linkage metadata, and duplicate ranking uses recurrence as a tie-breaker after exact fingerprint matches.
  - Duplicate-suppressed Bug Monitor incidents now persist a normalized `duplicate_summary` envelope with match count, best-match details, recurrence metadata, and linked-issue unions so tracker UIs can explain suppression deterministically after reload/reconnect.
  - Manual `POST /bug-monitor/report` suppression now returns that same normalized `duplicate_summary` envelope, and failure-pattern matching reuses the exact-fingerprint -> recurrence -> score ordering so the reported best match stays aligned with runtime suppression.
  - Bug Monitor failure-pattern reuse responses now attach the same normalized `duplicate_summary` envelope alongside any raw `duplicate_matches`, and coder-originated duplicate matches now emit a stable `match_reason` so exact-fingerprint priority survives through shared ranking and summary shaping.

- Initial Tandem Coder engine API foundation
  - Added the first engine-owned coder endpoints:
    - `GET /coder/status`
    - `GET /coder/projects`
    - `GET /coder/projects/{project_id}`
    - `GET /coder/projects/{project_id}/runs`
    - `POST /coder/projects/{project_id}/runs`
    - `GET /coder/projects/{project_id}/bindings`
    - `PUT /coder/projects/{project_id}/bindings`
    - `POST /coder/runs`
    - `GET /coder/runs`
    - `GET /coder/runs/{id}`
    - `GET /coder/runs/{id}/artifacts`
    - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/execute-next`
    - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/execute-all`
  - `GET /coder/status` now summarizes total runs, active/awaiting-approval counts, workflow distribution, run-status distribution, project count, and the latest coder run directly from engine-owned run state.
  - `GET /coder/projects` now summarizes known repo bindings, workflow coverage, latest run metadata, and project-level coder policy from existing engine-owned run state.
  - `GET /coder/projects/{project_id}` now returns project policy, explicit binding, and recent run state in one engine-backed payload.
  - `GET /coder/projects/{project_id}/runs` now returns project-scoped coder runs with execution policy and merge policy summaries already attached.
  - `POST /coder/projects/{project_id}/runs` now creates coder runs from a saved project binding and fails closed with `CODER_PROJECT_BINDING_REQUIRED` until that binding exists.
  - Shared coder memory retrieval is now explicit in the engine contract: run detail and `GET /coder/runs/{id}/memory-hits` now include `retrieval_policy`, and the underlying helper now combines repo candidates, project memory, and governed memory with workflow-specific ranking.
  - `issue_triage` retrieval now prioritizes `regression_signal` alongside `failure_pattern`, and promoted triage reproduction failures can now be reused across related issues through governed memory because regression-signal promotion accepts reproduction and validation evidence artifacts in addition to summary/review artifacts.
  - `issue_triage` can now infer duplicate pull-request candidates from historical `duplicate_linkage` memory and writes its own `duplicate_linkage` candidate when triage concludes an issue is already covered by linked PR history.
  - triage/fix retrieval now gives `duplicate_linkage` more weight, so cross-workflow issue↔PR history surfaces ahead of more generic triage memory when linked duplicates exist.
  - `pr_review` now reuses prior `merge_recommendation_memory` on the same PR, and `merge_recommendation` now reuses prior `review_memory` on the same PR, so adjacent workflow context is available through the shared retrieval layer instead of depending only on governed-memory fallback.
  - Real issue-fix PR submit now writes `duplicate_linkage` memory linking issue and pull-request numbers, returns that candidate in submit responses/events/artifacts, and makes it reusable in follow-on PR review retrieval.
  - Generic terminal coder transitions now backfill a reusable `run_outcome` candidate for failed and cancelled runs when no richer workflow-specific outcome already exists, and return that generated candidate directly from the transition response.
  - Bug Monitor triage summaries now also persist governed `regression_signal` memory alongside `failure_pattern`, with a matching context-run artifact and structured expected-behavior context for later post-failure reuse.
  - Explicit project bindings can now be stored independently of runs, and `/coder/projects` now prefers those saved bindings over derived run bindings when both exist.
  - Coder runs now persist as thin metadata records linked to engine context runs rather than introducing a frontend-owned workflow store.
  - Added structured intermediate and final artifacts for triage inspection/reproduction, issue-fix validation and patch evidence, PR review evidence, and merge readiness.
  - Added governed-memory-aware retrieval and reusable coder memory outputs across `issue_triage`, `issue_fix`, `pr_review`, and `merge_recommendation`.
  - Added engine-owned issue-fix PR drafting and approval-gated submit handoff through:
    - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-draft`
    - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-submit`
  - PR submit artifacts now preserve stable repo context plus a canonical `submitted_github_ref`, and GitHub/MCP result parsing now accepts minimal number-only PR result shapes so downstream review and merge flows have a stable PR handoff target.
  - Fixed PR submit MCP tool resolution so builtin raw tool names and runtime namespaced tool names both resolve correctly, and added real HTTP-backed regression coverage for non-dry-run PR submission.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/follow-on-run`, which can spawn `pr_review` or `merge_recommendation` runs directly from the canonical submitted PR ref on an issue-fix submit artifact.
  - PR submit artifacts now also include machine-readable `follow_on_runs` templates so later review/merge workflows can be chained from the engine-owned submission payload without reconstructing run inputs in the UI.
  - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-submit` now also returns `submitted_github_ref`, `pull_request`, and `follow_on_runs` directly in the response so clients do not need a second artifact read to continue the workflow.
  - `coder.pr.submitted` events now also include the canonical submitted PR ref, PR number, and follow-on workflow templates so streaming clients can continue the workflow without a follow-up fetch.
  - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-submit` can now optionally auto-create follow-on `pr_review` and `merge_recommendation` runs through engine-owned chaining, returning those spawned runs directly in `spawned_follow_on_runs`.
  - Merge auto-follow-ons now require explicit `allow_auto_merge_recommendation` opt-in; otherwise submit auto-spawns review only, records the skipped merge follow-on with a deterministic reason, and emits that policy outcome in the submit response, artifact, and `coder.pr.submitted` event.
  - Spawned and manual follow-on coder runs now persist `parent_coder_run_id`, `origin`, and `origin_artifact_type`, so downstream review and merge runs can be traced back to the issue-fix PR submission that created them.
  - `pr_review` now uses the real coder worker-session bridge during `review_pull_request`, persists `coder_pr_review_worker_session`, and feeds parsed worker output into the existing review-evidence and final summary artifacts instead of fabricating review text inline.
  - `merge_recommendation` now uses the real coder worker-session bridge during `assess_merge_readiness`, persists `coder_merge_recommendation_worker_session`, and feeds parsed worker output into the existing readiness and final summary artifacts instead of hardcoded merge guidance.
  - `issue_triage` now uses the real coder worker-session bridge during repo inspection, persists `coder_issue_triage_worker_session`, and reuses parsed worker output for inspection, reproduction, and final summary artifacts instead of synthetic triage step payloads.
  - Follow-on review and merge runs now persist structured `origin_policy` metadata, so downstream runs know whether they were manual vs auto-spawned and whether merge auto-spawn had been explicitly opted in at submit time.
  - PR-submit `follow_on_runs` templates now carry the same parent/origin policy context that spawned review and merge runs use, so clients can preview engine chaining policy before creating any downstream runs.
  - Follow-on run `origin_policy` now consistently uses `merge_auto_spawn_opted_in` for both templates and spawned/manual runs, avoiding two names for the same merge auto-spawn decision.
  - Merge-recommendation follow-on runs created from PR submission are now execution-gated until a sibling `pr_review` run completes, so merge assessment cannot run ahead of review even when the follow-on run already exists.
  - PR-submit follow-on templates and merge follow-on run metadata now expose `required_completed_workflow_modes`, so clients can surface the review-before-merge prerequisite without inferring policy locally.
  - `GET /coder/runs` and `GET /coder/runs/{id}` now return engine-owned `execution_policy` summaries for coder runs, so clients can tell when a merge follow-on is blocked by review policy before attempting execution.
  - PR-submit handoff payloads now also expose follow-on `execution_policy_preview` metadata and live `execution_policy` on spawned follow-on runs, so clients can render review-before-merge gating directly from the submit response, artifact, and event payloads without an extra run fetch.
  - `POST /coder/runs` now also returns `execution_policy`, so manual follow-on creation responses are immediately truthful about blocked merge-recommendation runs without requiring a follow-up read.
  - Blocked `execute-next` / `execute-all` responses now also return `coder_run`, `run`, and `execution_policy`, so clients can stay in sync after a policy block without issuing a second fetch.
  - Blocked `execute-next` / `execute-all` now also emit `coder.run.phase_changed` with `event_type = execution_policy_blocked`, so streaming clients can react to follow-on policy blocks without polling.
  - Merge-recommendation summaries that come back `merge` with no remaining blockers/checks/approvals now stop in `awaiting_approval` and emit `coder.approval.required`, instead of looking fully completed before an operator approves the recommendation.
  - Approving a merge-ready recommendation through `POST /coder/runs/{id}/approve` now completes the run cleanly with `merge_recommendation_approved` instead of sending it back to `running`.
  - That approval step now also writes a `coder_merge_execution_request` artifact and emits `coder.merge.recommended`, giving the engine a concrete post-approval merge handoff before a real merge MCP path exists.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/merge-submit`, which reuses that handoff artifact, gates on `github.merge_pull_request`, persists `coder_merge_submission`, and can execute a real MCP-backed merge for approved merge recommendations.
  - `merge-submit` now also blocks on the handoff artifact itself, so it will not merge unless the latest `coder_merge_execution_request` still says `recommendation = merge` and has no remaining blockers, required checks, or required approvals.
  - `merge-submit` now defaults to `submit_mode = manual` and blocks `submit_mode = auto` unless the follow-on run's origin policy explicitly opted into auto merge execution, keeping merge execution manual-by-default even after recommendation approval.
  - `merge-submit` now also requires an approving sibling `pr_review` for issue-fix follow-on merge runs, so merge execution is blocked if the completed review still reports blockers or requested changes.
  - `merge-submit` now evaluates the latest completed sibling `pr_review`, so a newer review with requested changes overrides an older approval instead of whichever completed review is discovered first.
  - Merge-ready approval responses and `GET /coder/runs/{id}` for merge runs now expose a dynamic `merge_submit_policy` summary, so clients can see whether manual or auto merge-submit is currently blocked before attempting the merge call.
  - `coder_merge_execution_request` artifacts and `coder.merge.recommended` events now also carry a `merge_submit_policy_preview`, so streaming and artifact-driven clients receive the same merge-submit policy context without a follow-up read.
  - `merge-submit` now also requires the merge run itself to be an auto-spawned follow-on before `submit_mode = auto` is eligible, so a manual follow-on merge run cannot escalate into auto merge execution even if the parent PR submit opted into auto merge recommendation.
  - `merge_submit_policy` summaries now also include `preferred_submit_mode`, so clients and future automation can consume an engine-owned recommendation instead of inferring manual-vs-auto behavior from blocked flags alone.
  - `merge_submit_policy` summaries now also make the current execution contract explicit with `explicit_submit_required = true` and `auto_execute_after_approval = false`, so clients know approval alone never auto-merges today.
  - `merge_submit_policy` summaries now also include `auto_execute_eligible` and `auto_execute_block_reason`, so clients can distinguish “auto is preferred later” from “auto can run now” without reverse-engineering that from other flags.
  - Added `GET /coder/projects/{project_id}/policy` and `PUT /coder/projects/{project_id}/policy`, with a default-off project-level `auto_merge_enabled` switch that now feeds `merge_submit_policy.auto_execute_policy_enabled` and changes merge-ready auto-execution blocking to `project_auto_merge_policy_disabled` until a project explicitly opts in.
  - `merge_submit_policy.auto_execute_eligible` now becomes `true` when a merge run is auto-spawned, review-approved, merge-ready, and the project-level `auto_merge_enabled` switch is on, while still keeping `explicit_submit_required = true` and `auto_execute_after_approval = false` so the engine reports readiness truthfully without auto-merging yet.
  - `POST /coder/runs` now also returns `merge_submit_policy` for merge-recommendation runs, so manual and spawned merge follow-on creation responses surface project auto-merge policy and merge-submit prerequisites immediately instead of forcing a follow-up run read.
  - `merge_submit_policy.auto_execute_block_reason` now reports the earliest real blocker (`requires_merge_execution_request`, `requires_completed_pr_review_follow_on`, `requires_approved_pr_review_follow_on`, etc.) instead of collapsing those states back to a generic `preferred_submit_mode_manual`.
  - PR-submit `follow_on_runs` templates now also carry `merge_submit_policy_preview` for merge follow-ons, so clients can see project auto-merge policy and merge-submit prerequisites before the merge run even exists.
  - Merge-ready `coder.approval.required` events and `merge-recommendation-summary` responses now also carry `merge_submit_policy`, so streaming clients can see merge-submit readiness and project auto-merge policy without fetching the run.
  - Auto-follow-on merge chaining now normalizes through review first, so requesting `merge_recommendation` auto-spawn implicitly schedules `pr_review` ahead of merge instead of trusting the client to order those runs correctly.
  - `issue_triage` coder run creation now seeds a deterministic context-run task template for issue normalization, memory retrieval, repo inspection, reproduction, and triage artifact writing.
  - Added initial `coder.run.created` engine event emission and backend regression coverage for coder create/get/list/artifact behavior.
  - `issue_triage` now has a first real worker bridge: `execute-next` claims the next runnable context task through the shared lease/claim runtime and dispatches deterministic inspection, reproduction, and final summary actions so the run can complete end to end without frontend-owned orchestration.
  - `issue_fix` now uses that same `execute-next` worker bridge: the engine claims fix tasks through the shared task runtime, advances inspection and preparation nodes through workflow progression, and dispatches validation plus final summary handlers to complete the run end to end.
  - `pr_review` now also uses `execute-next`: the engine claims review tasks through the same task runtime, advances the initial inspection node through workflow progression, and dispatches review-evidence plus final summary handlers to complete the run end to end.
  - `merge_recommendation` now uses `execute-next` too: the engine claims merge-readiness tasks through the same task runtime, advances the initial inspection node through workflow progression, and dispatches readiness plus final recommendation handlers to complete the run end to end.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/execute-all`, which loops that same engine-owned task runtime until a coder run completes, fails, cancels, exhausts runnable tasks, or hits a configured step cap.
  - Added an initial fail-closed readiness gate for `issue_triage`: required GitHub issue capability bindings must exist, and any explicitly requested MCP servers must be configured and connected.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/memory-candidates` so `issue_triage` runs can persist engine-owned memory candidate payloads and attach them to the linked context run as `coder_memory_candidate` artifacts.
  - New `issue_triage` runs now seed their retrieval task with prior repo/issue memory candidate hints from earlier coder runs.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/triage-summary` so the engine can write a concrete `triage.summary.json` artifact and attach it as `coder_triage_summary`.
  - Added `GET /coder/runs/{id}/memory-hits` so clients can inspect ranked triage retrieval hits for the current coder run.
  - `issue_triage` bootstrap now combines prior `coder_memory_candidate` payloads with project semantic memory search and writes a `coder_memory_hits` artifact into the linked context run.
  - Triage summary writes now auto-generate reusable `triage_memory` and `run_outcome` memory candidates so later coder runs can reuse structured triage conclusions without a separate manual candidate write.
  - `issue_triage` memory retrieval now also ranks governed/shared memory hits from the existing engine memory database alongside project semantic memory and prior coder-local candidates.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/memory-candidates/{candidate_id}/promote` so reviewed coder memory candidates can be stored in governed memory and optionally promoted to shared visibility with reviewer metadata.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/approve` and `POST /coder/runs/{id}/cancel` as thin coder control endpoints over the existing context-run transition model.
  - Those control endpoints now emit `coder.run.phase_changed`, and cancelled coder runs now project a dedicated `cancelled` phase.
  - `issue_triage` readiness now reuses the shared engine capability-readiness evaluator, so coder run creation blocks on the same missing/unbound/disconnected/auth-pending conditions surfaced by `/capabilities/readiness`.
  - Explicit `mcp_servers` requested by coder runs still remain hard requirements on top of that shared readiness check.
  - Coder memory promotion now reuses the generic governed-memory `memory_put` / `memory_promote` path instead of a coder-specific direct DB bridge.
  - Run-scoped governed-memory capability issuance is now shared through `skills_memory.rs` helpers, so coder workflows derive subject and tier policy through the same helper path as the generic memory routes.
  - Fixed cold-start global memory initialization so `/memory/*` routes create the memory DB parent directory before opening SQLite.
  - Coder lifecycle and artifact events now share a normalized payload shape, and `coder.artifact.added` includes explicit `kind` metadata so desktop and other clients can consume coder events without per-event special casing.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-review-summary` so `pr_review` runs can write a structured `coder_pr_review_summary` artifact and emit a first `run_outcome` memory candidate.
  - Added the first `pr_review` coder workflow skeleton with GitHub PR readiness checks, seeded review task graphs, and direct MCP GitHub pull-request capability bindings.
  - `pr_review` now defaults to pull-request-specific memory queries, bootstraps a `coder_memory_hits` artifact at run creation, and reuses prior review `run_outcome` memory during later reviews of the same repo/PR.
  - `pr_review` summary writes now also emit reusable `review_memory` candidates, and follow-on PR reviews can retrieve that review-specific memory through the shared coder memory-hits path.
  - `pr_review` summary writes now also emit `regression_signal` candidates when review input includes historical regression signals, and later PR reviews can retrieve those signals through the same repo/PR memory-hits path.
  - Added the first `merge_recommendation` coder workflow skeleton with PR-backed readiness checks, seeded merge-assessment tasks, bootstrapped `coder_memory_hits`, and `POST /coder/runs/{id}/merge-recommendation-summary` for structured merge recommendation artifacts.
  - Merge recommendation summaries now emit reusable `merge_recommendation_memory` and `run_outcome` candidates so later runs can reuse prior merge guidance without needing a separate manual candidate write.
  - Added a dedicated `merge_recommendation_memory` candidate kind so merge guidance is stored as reusable recommendation knowledge instead of only a generic run outcome.
  - Added the first `issue_fix` coder workflow skeleton with issue-backed readiness checks, seeded fix and validation tasks, bootstrapped `coder_memory_hits`, and `POST /coder/runs/{id}/issue-fix-summary` for structured fix summary artifacts that emit reusable `run_outcome` memory.
  - `issue_fix` summary writes now also emit reusable `fix_pattern` memory so later fix runs can reuse prior patch strategies and validation context.
  - `issue_fix` memory retrieval now ranks same-issue `fix_pattern` and issue-fix `run_outcome` hits ahead of generic triage memory so fix runs surface prior patch strategy first.
  - `merge_recommendation` memory retrieval now ranks same-PR `merge_recommendation_memory`, merge run outcomes, and regression signals ahead of generic review memory so merge runs surface prior merge guidance first.
  - `merge_recommendation` ranking now also prefers policy-rich same-PR memories that carry blockers, required checks, or required approvals over generic merge summaries, so readiness-specific history surfaces first.
  - `pr_review` memory retrieval now ranks same-PR `review_memory`, `regression_signal`, and PR review outcomes ahead of generic triage memory so review runs surface prior review guidance first.
  - `pr_review` ranking now also prefers richer same-PR review memories that carry blockers, requested changes, or regression signals over generic review summaries, so actionable review history surfaces first.
  - `issue_triage` memory retrieval now ranks same-issue `failure_pattern`, triage-memory, and triage run outcomes ahead of generic hits so duplicate/root-cause history surfaces first during new triage runs.
  - `issue_fix` summary writes now also emit a dedicated `coder_validation_report` artifact when validation steps or results are provided, so validation evidence is consumable without parsing the fix summary.
  - `issue_fix` summary writes now also emit reusable `validation_memory` candidates, and same-issue fix retrieval ranks that validation-specific memory ahead of generic triage memory so later fix runs can reuse prior validation evidence directly.
  - `issue_fix` now uses a real coder-owned worker session during `prepare_fix`: the engine resolves a worker model, creates a scoped repo session, runs a real prompt through `run_prompt_async_with_context`, and persists the transcript as a `coder_issue_fix_worker_session` artifact before validation continues.
  - `prepare_fix` now also derives a deterministic `coder_issue_fix_plan` artifact from that worker transcript so later validation and summary steps have a stable, engine-owned fix-plan record to consume.
  - `validate_fix` now also launches a real coder-owned validation session and persists a `coder_issue_fix_validation_session` artifact, so validation evidence comes from the same engine session/runtime path instead of a synthetic placeholder step.
  - `prepare_fix` now also harvests concrete changed-file evidence from worker tool invocations and persists it as `coder_changed_file_evidence`, giving later fix validation and UI surfaces an engine-owned record of touched paths when the worker actually edits files.
  - Changed-file evidence now captures per-file tool provenance plus short content previews when worker tool args include editable payloads, and final `coder_patch_summary` artifacts now carry those harvested entries forward for downstream review surfaces.
  - `issue_fix` patch evidence now also snapshots the touched workspace files from the engine side, attaching lightweight file-existence, size, line-count, and preview metadata to both `coder_changed_file_evidence` and `coder_patch_summary`.
  - Final issue-fix summaries now also emit a dedicated `coder_patch_summary` artifact that ties the structured fix summary to changed files plus the linked worker and validation session IDs, giving desktop and future UIs a stable engine-owned patch-summary surface before full diff harvesting is added.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-draft` for `issue_fix`, which builds an engine-owned `coder_pr_draft` artifact from the latest fix summary, validation, and patch evidence and emits `coder.approval.required` for human review before submission.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-submit`, which reuses that `coder_pr_draft`, enforces fail-closed `github.create_pull_request` readiness, and writes a `coder_pr_submission` artifact for dry-run or approved submission flows.
  - `issue_fix` validation and final summary generation now reuse those worker-session, validation-session, and issue-fix-plan artifacts, attaching session IDs, transcript excerpts, and plan-derived fields instead of only generic inline placeholders.
  - Fixed a small set of ownership bugs in `skills_memory.rs` that were blocking `tandem-server` validation for the shared governed-memory path used by coder promotion and worker-backed issue-fix execution.
  - `issue_triage` memory retrieval now ranks same-issue `failure_pattern`, `triage_memory`, and issue-triage `run_outcome` hits above generic project/governed matches so triage runs surface prior failure signatures and conclusions first.
  - Repo-scoped coder memory retrieval is now GitHub-ref-aware, so `pr_review` and `merge_recommendation` get a true same-PR boost instead of only issue-number or recency bias.
  - Promoted coder memory now stores richer searchable governed-memory content from workflow payloads, including fix strategy, root cause, blockers, required checks, approvals, validation details, and regression summaries instead of only a bare summary string.
  - Merge recommendation summaries now also write a dedicated `coder_merge_readiness_report` artifact whenever blockers, required checks, or required approvals are present, so merge readiness state is directly consumable without reparsing the summary artifact.

## v0.4.1 (2026-03-07)

- Strict swarm write reliability and cross-client engine retries
  - Fixed streamed OpenAI/OpenRouter tool-call parsing so multi-chunk `write` args keep the correct tool-call identity and no longer lose later argument chunks when the provider omits the tool name on follow-up deltas.
  - Hardened write-argument recovery for truncated/malformed JSON: the engine can now recover `content` even when `path` is missing, and the default provider output budget was raised from `2048` to `16384` so large single-file artifacts are less likely to be clipped.
  - Session/tool history persistence now preserves write args/results through the verifier path, avoiding false `NO_TOOL_ACTIVITY_NO_WORKSPACE_CHANGE` / strict-write failure classifications when tools actually ran.
  - Swarm planner/worker prompts now favor one implementation task for single-file goals, reducing over-decomposition on greenfield artifact generation.
  - Added consistent local-engine retry handling for transient transport failures and `ENGINE_STARTING` responses across the control-panel orchestrator, Tauri desktop sidecar client, and Rust TUI client.

- Provider catalog honesty in Settings and `/provider`
  - `GET /provider` now returns explicit catalog metadata so clients can distinguish live remote model catalogs from config-defined catalogs and manual-entry-only providers.
  - Removed the synthetic single-model fallback behavior that made most non-OpenRouter providers appear to have exactly one available model.
  - Live remote model discovery is now attempted for supported providers (`openrouter`, `openai`, `groq`, `mistral`, `together`), while unsupported/non-generic providers stay configurable through manual model entry.
  - Control-panel Settings now renders provider rows more honestly:
    - real counts for remote catalogs
    - `configured models` for config-defined catalogs
    - `manual entry` when live discovery is unavailable

- Headless-first Chromium browser automation with readiness diagnostics
  - Added a new `tandem-browser` sidecar for local Chromium automation over stdio, with typed browser actions for open, navigate, snapshot, click, type, press, wait, extract, screenshot, and close.
  - Browser automation is now explicitly headless-first: it works on a VPS with no GUI as long as the sidecar and a Chromium-based browser are installed on the same host as `tandem-engine`.
  - Added readiness diagnostics that do real browser launch smoke tests, detect missing Chrome/Chromium/Edge/Brave installs, surface Linux install hints, and explain non-runnable states instead of silently omitting browser capability.
  - Added engine-managed sidecar install/distribution:
    - `tandem-engine browser install`
    - `POST /browser/install`
    - managed sidecar discovery from Tandem shared `binaries/` storage so standard installs do not need `TANDEM_BROWSER_SIDECAR`
    - standalone `tandem-browser-*` assets in the release workflows
  - Added operator/browser status surfaces across the stack:
    - `GET /browser/status`
    - browser summary on `GET /global/health`
    - `tandem-engine browser status`
    - `tandem-engine browser doctor`
    - `POST /browser/smoke-test`
    - `tandem-browser doctor --json`
    - TUI `/browser status` and `/browser doctor`
    - control-panel Browser Diagnostics card in Settings with sidecar install and smoke-test actions
  - Replaced the generic model-facing browser action shape with typed engine tools:
    - `browser_status`
    - `browser_open`
    - `browser_navigate`
    - `browser_snapshot`
    - `browser_click`
    - `browser_type`
    - `browser_press`
    - `browser_wait`
    - `browser_extract`
    - `browser_screenshot`
    - `browser_close`
  - Browser tool registration now works in both server and one-shot runtime paths, and `browser_status` remains available even when full browser execution is blocked.
  - Screenshots and oversized extracts now persist as artifacts/files rather than being returned as large inline base64 payloads.
  - Session cancel, global dispose, stale-run reaping, and routine-pause flows now clean up tracked browser sessions to avoid leaked headless browser state.
  - Added an engine-owned smoke test that opens `https://example.com`, snapshots it, extracts visible text, and closes the browser session so operators can validate the full runtime path from the control panel or direct API calls.
  - Sidecar stdio failures now preserve sidecar stderr and retry once after an unexpected disconnect before returning an error.

- Orchestrator multi-run fan-in + run workspace parity
  - tandem-engine now provides multiplex orchestration event fan-in at `GET /context/runs/events/stream` so one SSE connection can track multiple run IDs concurrently.
  - stream cursor decode/encode support was added so reconnects can resume from the last acknowledged event window.
  - control panel now exposes `/api/orchestrator/events` backed by multiplex stream proxying with legacy fallback logic for older engine behavior.
  - added `/api/orchestrator/events/health` to quickly verify orchestrator streaming status and fallback mode.
  - control panel orchestration state now tracks a run registry (active + historical runs) instead of single-run replacement.
  - added a dedicated Orchestrator workspace view with run selection and start-state behavior aligned to desktop orchestration UX.
  - orchestration and chat history UI now use a consistent history icon style for session/run lists.

- Blackboard as central coordination layer + control panel parity
  - Engine blackboard now includes first-class task coordination state (`blackboard.tasks`) with workflow references, task lineage fields, lease metadata, retries, and optimistic task revision (`task_rev`).
  - Added append-only task patch operations:
    - `add_task`
    - `update_task_lease`
    - `update_task_state`
  - Added task lifecycle endpoints:
    - `POST /context/runs/{run_id}/tasks`
    - `POST /context/runs/{run_id}/tasks/claim`
    - `POST /context/runs/{run_id}/tasks/{task_id}/transition`
    - `GET /context/runs/{run_id}/blackboard/patches`
  - Added task lifecycle event emission on context runs (`context.task.created/claimed/started/completed/failed/...`) carrying `patch_seq` + `task_rev` for deterministic UI refresh.
  - Added optional `context_run_id` support on `/pack-builder/preview`, `/pack-builder/apply`, `/pack-builder/cancel`, and `/pack-builder/pending`; when provided, pack-builder lifecycle is mirrored into blackboard task state/events for that context run.
  - `automation_v2_dag` node status now projects into context blackboard tasks; `GET /automations/v2/runs/{run_id}` now includes `contextRunID` for that projection.
  - Added optional `context_run_id` on `/skills/router/match` and `/skills/compile`; skill routing/compile outputs now emit blackboard task records for workflow coordination.
  - Desktop convergence: Tauri `orchestrator_get_blackboard` and `orchestrator_get_blackboard_patches` now read engine context-run blackboard/patch streams first, with local orchestrator storage as temporary fallback.
  - Additional desktop convergence: legacy read commands (`orchestrator_get_events`, `orchestrator_list_runs`, `orchestrator_load_run`) now use engine context-run APIs first, with local fallback only for legacy run data.
  - Added compatibility guard for legacy persisted blackboards that predate `tasks`; engine now loads them with safe defaults.
  - Control panel SSE parity: `/api/swarm/events` now emits incremental `blackboard_patch` events alongside run events so blackboard-only updates refresh live.
  - Swarm task board UI hardening: very long task/prompt titles now clamp and wrap by default with `More/Less` expansion, preventing layout blowout.
  - Replay now includes blackboard parity checks for task revision/count/status and returns replayed/persisted blackboard payloads for drift diagnostics.
  - Control panel swarm shim now forwards blackboard patch streams, and `SwarmPage` now supports blackboard docked, expanded, and fullscreen debug views with decision lineage, agent lanes, workflow progress, artifact lineage, and drift indicators.
  - Added contract/regression tests for claim races, command-id idempotency, optimistic revision mismatch, monotonic patch sequence, and replay parity.
  - Fixed Swarm Continue/Resume no-op path in control panel executor:
    - if driver returns no `selected_step_id` because a step is already `in_progress`, executor now resumes that step instead of exiting
    - continue/resume API responses now include execution diagnostics (`started`, `requeued`, `selectedStepId`, `whyNextStep`)
    - Swarm page now surfaces `lastError` to make provider/session failures visible without inspecting server logs
    - execution sessions now fall back to configured swarm provider/model when older runs do not have provider/model fields populated
  - Added swarm fail-closed model resolution and dispatch guards:
    - execution model resolution now follows `run model -> swarm state model -> engine default provider/model` and fails fast if unresolved
    - `prompt_sync` empty/no-op responses now fail the step with explicit diagnostics instead of reporting false completion
    - loop guard stops repeated same-step execution when step state does not advance after completion (`STEP_STATE_NOT_ADVANCING`)
    - compatibility reconcile path now marks stale completed steps as `done` via engine API when run-state transitions lag, and emits `step_completion_reconciled`
    - `/api/swarm/status` now returns resolved model + executor state/reason for faster diagnosis
  - Added run list cleanup controls in control panel:
    - per-run `Hide` action and bulk `Hide Completed` action in Swarm view
    - hidden runs are user-scoped and persisted locally (`~/.tandem/control-panel/swarm-hidden-runs.json`)
    - hidden runs are filtered from `/api/swarm/runs` by default without deleting engine run data
  - Fixed completed-run false error UI state and added explicit output visibility:
    - normal completion no longer sets swarm `lastError` to `all steps are done; marking run completed`
    - Swarm now shows a `Run Output` panel with latest completed step, session ID, and assistant output preview
    - task `Open Session` links now resolve from step completion events (`session_id`) for reliable output access
    - status badges now use semantic colors for done/completed, failed, and in-progress states
  - Increased duplicate-signature retry headroom for write/edit loops:
    - `write`/`edit`/`multi_edit`/`apply_patch` duplicate call signature limit now defaults to `200` (was `3`)
    - `pack_builder` remains strict at `1`; shell tools remain strict at `2`
    - global override `TANDEM_TOOL_LOOP_DUPLICATE_SIGNATURE_LIMIT` remains supported
- Automation creation UX — simplified to "just describe what you want"
  - Replaced the fragmented `Agents`, `Packs`, and `Teams` pages with a single **Automations** hub (`AutomationsPage`).
  - New **4-step creation wizard**: describe your goal in plain English → pick a recurring schedule → choose how agents run → review & deploy. No YAML, no route navigation between pages.
  - **Execution mode selector** surfaces the orchestration options most users never found before: `Single Agent`, `Agent Team` (recommended), or `Swarm`. Agent Team is now the default — you get an orchestrated multi-agent run out of the box.
  - **My Automations** tab combines installed packs, scheduled routines, and recent run history in one scrollable view.
  - **Teams & Approvals** tab shows active agent-team instances and pending spawn approvals so operators can approve/deny without leaving the page.
  - Legacy deep-links (`#/agents`, `#/packs`, `#/teams`) all redirect to `/automations` — existing bookmarks keep working.
  - Primary sidebar trimmed from 12 items to 7: Dashboard, Chat, Automations, Swarm, Memory, Live Feed, Settings.

- Pack Builder orchestration/swarm execution modes
  - `pack_builder` tool now accepts `execution_mode` (`single` | `team` | `swarm`) and `max_agents` fields.
  - Generated routine YAML now includes an `args.orchestration` block so the runtime knows to dispatch to an agent team or parallel swarm instead of a single loop.
  - Default changed to `team` — new packs created via chat now schedule against an orchestrated agent team by default.

- Pack Builder zip storage race condition fixed
  - Generated pack zip artifacts are now written to a persistent directory (`~/.tandem/data/pack_builder_zips/` or `TANDEM_STATE_DIR/pack_builder_zips/`) instead of the OS temp directory.
  - This closes a silent failure mode where OS-level temp cleanup between the `preview` and `apply` steps caused `preview_artifacts_missing` errors, making pack creation via chat unreliable in practice.
  - Old staging directories for evicted plan IDs are now cleaned up automatically.

## v0.4.0 (2026-03-03)

- Pack Builder MCP-first automation flow (`v0.4.1` scope)
  - Added built-in `pack_builder` tool with `preview` and `apply` modes for creating Tandem packs from plain-English goals.
  - External capabilities are now connector-first: builder maps to MCP catalog servers by default and only falls back to built-ins when no match exists (with warnings).
  - Generated mission/agent artifacts now include explicit `mcp.*` tool IDs so routines invoke registered connectors directly.
  - Preview now returns connector candidates (docs/transport/auth/setup), selected MCP mapping, required secrets, and explicit approval requirements.
  - Apply now enforces user approvals for connector registration and pack install; routines are registered paused by default unless explicitly enabled.
  - Added persisted `pack_presets` metadata with registered MCP servers and required credentials for reliable preset reloads.
  - Added channel intent routing to automatically dispatch pack-creation requests to the `pack_builder` agent.
  - Added MCP-focused regression tests across server HTTP, preset registry, and channel routing.
  - Fixed engine boot race where pre-ready background tasks could panic with `runtime accessed before startup completion`; startup loops now gate on runtime readiness.
  - `pack_builder` is now baseline-allowed in engine permission defaults so first-run pack creation from chat/channels does not timeout on tool approval prompts.
  - Added runtime loop guardrails for `pack_builder` to reduce token waste on repeated identical tool calls (terminal follow-up behavior + duplicate-signature limit `1`).

- Semantic tool retrieval for MCP-heavy toolsets (`v0.4.1` scope)
  - Added embedding-backed semantic tool retrieval in `ToolRegistry` so the engine can send a relevant top-K tool subset instead of all schemas every turn.
  - Added startup bulk indexing (`tools.index_all`) plus incremental indexing on runtime tool registration (`register_tool`) so MCP servers connected after startup are indexed immediately.
  - Added index cleanup on `unregister_tool` and `unregister_by_prefix` so MCP disconnect/refresh does not leave stale vectors.
  - Engine loop now uses semantic retrieval by default (`TANDEM_SEMANTIC_TOOL_RETRIEVAL=1`) with `TANDEM_SEMANTIC_TOOL_RETRIEVAL_K` default `24` (aligned with existing expanded tool cap behavior).
  - Explicit allowlist/policy matches are unioned from the full tool list to prevent required tools from being dropped by top-K retrieval.
  - Runtime system prompt now includes a compact connected-integrations catalog (MCP server names only), gated by `TANDEM_MCP_CATALOG_IN_SYSTEM_PROMPT`.
  - Graceful fallback remains intact: when embeddings are unavailable/disabled, retrieval falls back to full tool listing.
  - Reliability hardening:
    - action-heavy prompts now trigger automatic fallback to full tool list when semantic top-K omits required web/email tool families
    - non-offered tool calls are rejected with available-tool hints instead of silently executing guessed names
    - assistant cannot claim email delivery succeeded unless a successful email-like tool action was executed in the run

- Pack Builder autonomous routines + routine-run connect reliability (`v0.4.1` scope)
  - Pack Builder apply now defaults to autonomous execution for unattended automation:
    - generated routines are enabled by default (`status=active`)
    - generated routines default to `requires_approval=false`
    - pack-builder apply API defaults approval flags to `true` unless explicitly overridden
  - Generated routine YAML from pack-builder now reflects no-approval default.
  - Increased default provider stream connect timeout from `30000` to `90000` ms to reduce routine runs failing before the model begins streaming.
  - Updated env/setup defaults accordingly:
    - `.env.example`
    - `examples/vps-web-portal/engine.env.example`
    - quickstart/VPS setup scripts

- Routine builder MCP tool selection UX (`v0.4.1` scope)
  - The routine editor now includes an MCP tool picker so users can search discovered MCP tools and add them directly to the routine allowlist.
  - Added connected-server filtering to quickly scope tool selection to a specific MCP integration.
  - Prevents fragile manual typing of long `mcp.*` tool IDs in routines.

- MCP catalog moved into engine and exposed to frontends
  - Added engine-managed embedded catalog endpoints:
    - `GET /mcp/catalog`
    - `GET /mcp/catalog/{slug}/toml`
  - Added generated catalog assets under `crates/tandem-server/resources/mcp-catalog` (index + per-server TOML manifests).
  - Added catalog generator tooling at `scripts/generate-mcp-catalog.mjs` plus control-panel refresh script `npm run mcp:catalog:refresh`.
  - Catalog now includes curated official remote MCP entries for:
    - GitHub: `https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/`
    - Jira (Atlassian): `https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp`
    - Notion: `https://mcp.notion.com/mcp`
  - Default curated GitHub pack no longer assumes Docker; it points to the official remote endpoint.

- MCP capability readiness preflight (fail-closed)
  - Added `POST /capabilities/readiness` for pre-run validation of required capability IDs.
  - Readiness output now reports blocking issues for:
    - missing capability bindings
    - unbound required capabilities
    - missing/disconnected required MCP servers
    - auth-pending MCP tools
  - Added SDK/UI surface parity:
    - TypeScript SDK: `client.capabilities.readiness(...)`
    - Tauri command and frontend wrapper: `capability_readiness` / `capabilityReadiness(...)`
    - Control-panel MCP and Pack builder flows now call readiness before key save/run paths.

- Control panel MCP UX now includes searchable remote pack catalog
  - MCP settings page now displays searchable “Remote MCP Packs” sourced from engine catalog.
  - Added quick actions to apply pack transport/name and open generated TOML.
  - Added MCP-side readiness check UI with structured result rendering.

- Desktop (Tauri) MCP UX now includes searchable remote catalog
  - Added Tauri-side `mcp_catalog` command/wrapper to consume engine `GET /mcp/catalog`.
  - Extensions -> Integrations now includes searchable “Remote MCP catalog” list.
  - Added “Apply” action to prefill remote server name/URL and “Docs” quick-open links.

- Engine provider auth persistence + status API overhaul
  - Provider keys set via `PUT /auth/{provider}` are now durable across engine restarts.
  - Added engine-wide provider auth persistence in `tandem-core` with keychain-first storage and secure file fallback.
  - Engine startup now restores persisted provider keys into runtime provider config before provider registry init.
  - `GET /provider/auth` now returns real per-provider status including `has_key`, `configured`, `connected`, and `source`.
  - `DELETE /auth/{provider}` now removes both runtime and persisted provider auth state.

- Web control panel provider onboarding reliability
  - Provider readiness now enforces key presence for providers that require API keys (non-local providers).
  - Settings “Test Model Run” now pins explicit provider/model and blocks early when key prerequisites are missing.
  - Custom provider IDs are normalized consistently during save/test/delete key flows.
  - Reduced false “No stored key detected” states by consuming the real `/provider/auth` status response.
  - Replaced browser-native delete confirms with themed in-app confirmation modals for session, file, and pack deletion actions.

    - added migration prompts in Automations and legacy pages to route users to Settings

- Control Panel pack event cards + actions
  - Added `pack.*` event-specific cards in `Live Feed` with direct actions:
    - open Pack Library

    - install from attachment metadata (`attachment_id` + `path`)
  - Added `Pack Events` rail in Chat with the same one-click actions so pack detection/install can be handled without leaving chat context.

- Control panel packs compatibility fix
  - Fixed `Packs` view failures on environments where `state.client.packs` or `state.client.capabilities` namespaces are not present by adding direct `/api/engine/*` fallback calls for list/inspect/install/uninstall/export/update/discovery.
- Settings tab visual polish
  - Reworked Settings section switching UI from generic buttons to dedicated tab styling for stronger active-state clarity and cleaner presentation.
  - Kept Settings content grouped under one parent Settings card and fixed missing tab icon rendering by registering required Lucide icons (`package`, `sliders-horizontal`).
  - Added an Appearance section in Settings with a shared theme selector backed by `tandem.themeId`, and applied desktop-style color/font tokens at control-panel boot for tighter desktop parity.
  - Updated control-panel shell styles (cards, nav, buttons, inputs, tabs) to consume theme tokens for cleaner first paint and more consistent transitions across route/tab changes.
  - Replaced plain loading copy with themed skeleton placeholders and tokenized sidebar/brand surfaces for a more polished first impression during route changes.
  - Expanded registered Lucide icon set used in packs/preset/settings surfaces to avoid missing icons during rerenders (`archive`, `copy-plus`, `sparkles`, `shield-check`, `arrow-up-circle`, `badge-check`, `binary`, `list`, `pencil`).
  - Fixed Settings tab icon disappearance on section switches by rehydrating icons at full Settings view scope (not only inner subview scope).
  - Updated Chat surface styling to shared theme tokens (removed hardcoded `zinc/slate` color islands in chat rails/messages/composer and dynamic chat cards), so changing theme in Settings now applies across chat UI as expected.
  - Improved Porcelain light-theme readability by darkening text/border token values and applying markdown light-mode contrast overrides for clearer chat and formatted content.
  - Updated Automations page theme fidelity:
    - wrapped automations UI in a scoped theme surface
    - remapped residual `slate/zinc` utility classes to shared tokens
    - converted automations tab chips and wizard step chips to token-based colors

    - full theme list is back (`Web Control`, `Electric Blue`, `Emerald Night`, `Hello Bunny`, `Porcelain`, `Neon Riot`)
    - dropdown + quick-swatch selectors both apply themes instantly across the control panel
  - Hardened provider test behavior in Settings:
    - removed mixed `prompt_sync` + `prompt_async` test path
    - now runs a single async probe request to avoid run-conflict/stuck-wait behavior
    - extended provider-test wait timeout and improved status copy for non-`READY` successful replies
  - Isolated provider-test sessions from normal chat UX:
    - provider test uses internal non-workspace session metadata
    - chat session lists now hide internal `__provider_test__` sessions

- Internal execution tracking
  - Added implementation Kanban board:
    - `docs/internal/PACKS_PRESETS_IMPLEMENTATION_KANBAN.md`

  - Clarified Swarm positioning in UI as live orchestration (`Swarm (Live)`), with guidance to use Automations for persistent scheduled flows.
  - Fixed same-route hash/query navigation churn causing visible full-page flash on tab/wizard interactions (notably Automations), by using soft in-place rerenders and stale-render guards.
  - Improved Automation Builder clarity for per-agent model routing: provider/model now use settings-aware dropdowns with custom override options instead of manual free-text-only entry.
  - Fixed Automation Builder custom selection controls so choosing `Custom provider` / `Custom model` correctly enables manual input fields and keeps model selection usable.
  - Simplified Automation Builder agent policy inputs:
    - Skills input is plain text tags (comma-separated), not markdown/file-based.
    - MCP policy now uses connected-server selections from MCP config.
    - Tool policy now uses clear modes (`Standard`, `Read-only`, `Custom allow/deny`) instead of raw CSV-only mental model.
- Chat reliability and approvals-state fixes

  - Fixed missing right-rail tool activity by normalizing additional tool event families (`session.tool_call`, `session.tool_result`, and tool message-part updates).
  - Fixed stale approval requests not clearing: pending-status filtering, `once` semantics for one-shot approvals, and session-change refresh now keep approvals list consistent.
- MCP and Composio connection fixes
  - Web control panel MCP form now supports auth modes (`auto`, `x-api-key`, `bearer`, `custom`, `none`) with Composio-aware auto-header behavior.
  - MCP connect failures now surface server-side `last_error` details in UI/toasts.
  - Fixed runtime MCP parser to accept streamable/SSE JSON-RPC responses during discovery (`initialize`, `tools/list`), resolving Composio `Invalid MCP JSON response: expected value at line 1 column 1` failures.
- Persistent Automations V2 backend rollout (additive APIs)
  - Added `automations/v2` endpoints for create/list/get/patch/delete, run-now, automation pause/resume, run pause/resume/cancel, run history, and SSE events.
  - Added persistent V2 stores (`automations_v2.json`, `automation_v2_runs.json`) with checkpoint metadata for resumable runs.
  - Added V2 scheduler/executor loops with DAG node dispatch and run checkpoint updates.
- Per-agent model selection in V2 flows
  - Added per-agent `model_policy` support and node-level model resolution, enabling mixed-cost agent fleets (cheap models for easy tasks, stronger models for hard tasks).
- Automation cost telemetry and accounting
  - Added run-level `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `total_tokens`, and `estimated_cost_usd` fields for routine/automation records.
  - Added provider-usage aggregation to attribute token usage to active automation/routine runs.
  - Added configurable estimation rate via `TANDEM_TOKEN_COST_PER_1K_USD` for dashboard cost metrics.

  - Added Automation Builder V2 UI in `Agents` view with mission metadata, schedule fields, dynamic agent rows, per-agent model policy inputs, and DAG node editor.
  - Added Automations V2 list controls for run-now and pause/resume, plus run inspector actions for pause/resume/cancel.
  - Added one-click presets:
    - Engineering: `GitHub bug hunter`, `Code generation pipeline`, `Release notes + changelog`
    - Marketing/productivity: `Marketing content engine`, `Sales lead outreach`, `Inbox to tasks`
- Guide documentation updates (`guide/src`)
  - Updated SDK docs (`sdk/index`, `sdk/typescript`, `sdk/python`) for `automationsV2` / `automations_v2`, per-agent model routing examples, and agent template CRUD examples.
  - Updated MCP automation guide with a full `/automations/v2` DAG example and operations workflow.

## v0.3.27 (Unreleased)

- Engine dynamic tool routing + context compaction
  - Added intent-aware tool router in `tandem-core` to avoid publishing full tool catalogs on every provider call.
  - New request controls on async prompt paths:
    - `toolMode`: `auto | none | required`
    - `toolAllowlist`: explicit tool-name allowlist
    - `contextMode`: `auto | compact | full`
  - In `toolMode=auto`, engine now runs a no-tools first pass and escalates only when completion/user intent indicates tools are required.
  - MCP tools are hidden by default unless explicitly requested by intent or allowlist.
  - Added router tunables:
    - `TANDEM_TOOL_ROUTER_ENABLED` (default enabled)
    - `TANDEM_TOOL_ROUTER_MAX_TOOLS` (default `12`)
    - `TANDEM_TOOL_ROUTER_MAX_TOOLS_EXPANDED` (default `24`)

  - Python client: `prompt_async` / `prompt_async_parts` now accept `tool_mode`, `tool_allowlist`, `context_mode`.
- Engine/channel stability hardening for stuck runs
  - Fixed startup race in server prompt-context hook that could panic with `runtime accessed before startup completion` during boot.
  - Added provider stream timeout fail-safes in engine loop so stuck upstream calls fail and release active runs:
    - `TANDEM_PROVIDER_STREAM_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `30000`)
    - `TANDEM_PROVIDER_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `90000`)
    - `TANDEM_PROMPT_CONTEXT_HOOK_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `5000`)

  - Desktop (Tauri) Settings now includes a Bot Identity section (canonical name, desktop alias, preset, custom instructions).
  - Control Panel chat and Desktop chat now show configured bot identity names in assistant message/header labels.
  - Added optional bot avatar support via `identity.bot.avatar_url`, including avatar upload controls in Desktop/Control Panel settings and avatar rendering in Desktop chat plus portal/control-panel shell/chat identity UI.
  - Avatar uploads are now normalized server-side (decode/resize/re-encode), so larger source images are accepted and stored in a bounded form.
  - Core UI/TUI assistant-facing copy reduces hardcoded Tandem naming in primary runtime labels/placeholders.
- npm publish reliability (control panel)
  - Added missing `repository` metadata in `packages/tandem-control-panel/package.json`.

- Engine tool-loop retry protection and tuning
  - Added duplicate-signature loop guard for non-read-only tools (including repeated `bash` signatures) to stop runaway repeated provider/tool cycles.
  - Added deterministic terminal summary when duplicate-signature guard triggers, reducing token burn from repeated retries.
  - Added env tuning controls:
    - `TANDEM_MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS` (max provider/tool loop turns per run; default `25`)
    - `TANDEM_TOOL_LOOP_DUPLICATE_SIGNATURE_LIMIT` (max repeated identical mutable-tool signatures before guard; defaults: shell `2`, other mutable tools `3`)

- Telegram MarkdownV2 rendering and delivery hardening
  - Telegram heading rendering now outputs readable heading text style (instead of visible escaped `###` markers).
  - Long Telegram responses now split on markdown-safe boundaries where possible, reducing entity breakage across chunks.
  - Existing Telegram fallback behavior remains: if MarkdownV2 send fails, message retries as plain text.
- Telegram style profiles (bot presentation control)
  - Added Telegram style profile support: `default`, `compact`, `friendly`, `ops`.
  - Profile can be configured through channel config and is applied before MarkdownV2 conversion.
  - Added control-panel support for selecting Telegram style profile in Channels settings.
- Control panel routine automation UX + approvals
  - Added one-click routine policy shortcut: **Allow everything** (all tools, external integrations allowed, no approval gate).

    - run inspector
  - Closes the control-panel gap where approval-gated runs had no in-UI resolution path.

## v0.3.26 (Unreleased)

- Channel attachment ingestion + engine dispatch parity
  - Channel dispatcher now sends uploads as explicit `file` parts to `prompt_async` (instead of text-only attachment summaries).
  - Telegram/Discord/Slack flows preserve attachment metadata (`path`, `url`, `mime`, `filename`) for run prompts, resource references, and memory records.
  - Discord and Slack adapters now download inbound attachments to local `channel_uploads` storage, matching Telegram’s local-persistence behavior.
- Multimodal image dispatch for OpenAI-compatible providers
  - Provider message model is now attachment-aware and can encode image attachments in OpenAI-compatible `messages[].content` array payloads.
  - Engine loop now maps inbound image file parts into runtime provider attachments on first-iteration user context.
  - Local file attachment paths are converted to bounded data URLs before provider dispatch when needed.
  - Added model capability guardrails that fail fast when image input is attempted on a likely non-vision model.
- Engine storage visibility API
  - Added `GET /global/storage/files` to list files under the engine storage root with optional `path` and `limit` query controls.
  - Response includes root/base metadata and per-file size/mtime fields.
  - Added traversal protection: rejects absolute/parent-directory path traversal in requested subpath.

## v0.3.25 (Unreleased)

- Agent Swarm headless example (`examples/agent-swarm`)
  - Added manager/worker/reviewer/tester prompts and a full manager orchestration script using Tandem sessions, runs, event bus updates, shared resources, approvals, and routines.

  - Added durable global memory storage in `memory.sqlite` with FTS5-backed retrieval (`memory_records` + `memory_records_fts`), replacing transient in-process memory API state.
  - Added automatic ingestion capture from run outputs and event streams:
    - user messages
    - assistant finals
    - tool inputs/outputs
    - permission requests/replies
    - MCP auth-required/pending challenges
    - todo/question planning events
  - Added secret-safety write gate with scrub/block behavior before persistence and redaction metadata on stored records.
- Memory retrieval now runs during planning loops, not only run start
  - Introduced engine-loop prompt-context augmentation hook and server implementation that performs per-iteration memory search/injection.
  - Added memory context injection observability and scoring telemetry:
    - `memory.search.performed`
    - `memory.context.injected`
  - Added write lifecycle observability:
    - `memory.write.attempted`
    - `memory.write.succeeded`
    - `memory.write.skipped`
- Memory API surface expansion
  - Added `POST /memory/demote` for private/demoted tier fallback without deleting memory.
  - Existing `/memory/put`, `/memory/search`, `/memory/list`, `/memory/promote`, `/memory/{id}` now operate on durable global records.
  - Updated TypeScript/Python SDK memory clients for response-shape compatibility and added memory demote client helpers.
  - Synced API/Event contracts (`contracts/http.md`, `contracts/events.json`) and OpenAPI route summaries with the global-memory endpoint/event surface.
  - Refreshed user-facing docs and guides (README EN/zh-CN, SDK READMEs, guide SDK/headless/tools/engine command pages) for global-memory defaults and demotion workflow.

- MCP auth/retry behavior and loop hardening
  - Improved MCP auth challenge extraction to prefer structured payload fields (`structuredContent.message`, `structuredContent.authorization_url`) over noisy nested text blobs.
  - Sanitized/truncated auth-required messaging so web/TUI/channel users see clean authorization prompts instead of escaped JSON/instruction payload dumps.
  - Added stronger run-time auth/guard short-circuit behavior to reduce repeated MCP/tool-call churn in a single run.
- Engine run guard and failure ergonomics
  - Tightened guard-budget handling to fail fast in non-productive tool loops and return deterministic run-scoped messaging.
  - Reduced model-generated fallback ambiguity around “session limits” by keeping budget diagnostics explicit and per-run.
- Agent quickstart runtime stability updates
  - Chat send path now best-effort cancels stale active runs before starting a new run, reducing cross-send run carryover issues.
  - `Auto-allow all` preference now persists across portal restarts/reloads.
  - Quickstart run submission remains model-explicit and aligned with selected provider/model routing behavior.
- Provider compatibility hardening
  - Strengthened OpenAI-compatible function/tool serialization (name normalization + schema normalization + alias round-trip) to reduce strict-validator 400 failures with MCP-heavy tool sets.
- Quality and regression coverage
  - Added targeted tests for MCP auth parsing/message sanitization and per-run guard-budget summarization behavior.

## v0.3.24 (Unreleased)

- MCP reliability and auth hardening
  - Clarified and hardened MCP auth signaling via `mcp.auth.required` across engine/runtime and web chat handling.
  - MCP server runtime state now tracks auth/session continuity fields for operators and UIs:
    - `last_auth_challenge`
    - `mcp_session_id`
  - MCP connect/refresh failure handling now clears stale tool cache/session state and returns deterministic reconnect/error outcomes.
  - MCP connection bootstrap and reconnect behavior now better aligns tool availability with actual upstream server state.
- MCP tool-call resilience
  - Added engine-level MCP argument normalization before `tools/call` to recover common schema/key mismatches (for example camelCase/snake_case drift and common alias recovery such as `name -> task_title` where applicable).
  - This normalization runs in engine runtime and benefits all clients (web, TUI, channels), not only manual CLI calls.
- Agent quickstart runtime stability fixes
  - Provider setup gating and startup flow now prevent entering broken chat state when provider/model config is missing.
  - Chat now surfaces clearer run failure details and MCP auth-required diagnostics in-stream.
  - Stabilized chat/runtime behavior for non-response and blank-run regressions.
  - Aligned quickstart memory defaults with expected global-memory usage behavior in deployed engine setups.
  - Corrected quickstart proxy/auth behavior for `/engine` and portal key handling.
- SDK/npm publish reliability
  - Fixed `@frumu/tandem-client` npm provenance requirements with repository metadata alignment.
  - Hardened TS client npm publish flow in CI by ensuring install/build prerequisites (`typescript`, DOM libs, `tsup` + `tsc` declaration build path).
- Registry workflow controls and docs sync
  - Added independent PyPI publish toggle in release workflow so Python publishing can be controlled separately from npm.
  - Synced docs and top-level readme artifacts (including zh-CN parity and docs URL/badge updates) to match current release/runtime behavior.

## v0.3.23 (Unreleased)

- First SDK release announcement (TypeScript + Python)
  - `v0.3.23` is the first release where Tandem officially announces both client SDKs as release deliverables:
    - TypeScript: `@frumu/tandem-client`
    - Python: `tandem-client`
- SDK and example alignment (TypeScript + Python)
  - Added explicit TS SDK token lifecycle support via `TandemClient.setToken(token)` to support auth updates without rebuilding calling code.
  - Migrated `examples/agent-quickstart` to the current `@frumu/tandem-client` API surface:
    - replaced legacy `client.config.*` and `client.tools.*` usage
    - updated session/message/permissions flows to current namespaces
    - aligned run-state and event-stream handling with current SDK event/model contracts
  - Resolved strict TypeScript compile issues across quickstart pages so `agent-quickstart` builds cleanly.
- Release tooling parity
  - Updated `scripts/bump-version.sh` and `scripts/bump-version.ps1` to include both SDK packages:
    - `packages/tandem-client-ts/package.json`
    - `packages/tandem-client-py/pyproject.toml`
  - Ensures version bumps stay synchronized across engine/runtime crates, npm packages, and Python SDK releases.

## v0.3.22 (Unreleased)

- Engine-first context-driving reliability expansion
  - Extended engine context-run/runtime wiring used by Desktop + TUI: sequenced events, replay/checkpoint access, deterministic next-step selection, and todo->step synchronization for long-running workflows.
  - Reinforced source-of-truth model so operator surfaces consume engine state/events rather than transcript inference.
- Premium Blackboard UX for long runs (Desktop Orchestrator + Command Center)
  - Added shared Blackboard panel with docked/expanded/fullscreen modes.
  - Added decision spine + lineage rail views with selectable decision history and attached context nodes.
  - Added predictable follow behavior:
    - auto-focus only on new `meta_next_step_selected` decisions
    - manual navigation pauses follow until explicitly re-enabled
  - Added drift details drawer with mismatch flags, checkpoint/event markers, and copyable debug bundle payload.
  - Added keyboard-first controls (`E`, `F`, `Space`, `/`, `Esc`) and baseline fullscreen accessibility handling.
- Performance and test hardening
  - Switched blackboard refresh to event-family-gated + debounced fetches with `last_blackboard_refresh_seq` watermark to avoid redundant refresh bursts.
  - Added dedicated blackboard test target (`pnpm test:blackboard`) covering projection/filtering, follow-mode state, refresh policy, and drift UI state contracts.
- Orchestrator execution reliability and continuity
  - Planning now runs in two passes (analysis -> planner), improving task decomposition quality for complex objectives.
  - Builder prompts now include continuation context from the orchestrator context-pack so retries/resumes keep decision rationale.
  - Failed-task retry now preserves task session context by default; load/restart restores task session bindings from checkpoint snapshots.
  - Budget token usage now accounts for prompt + response across planner analysis, planner, builder, and validator calls.
  - Added explicit fail-fast checks for file-modifying tasks when recovery attempts invoke no tools, or only read-only tools.
  - Resume now preserves per-task failure rationale in prompt context to prevent "start from scratch" retries.
- Blackboard parity improvements (Orchestrator + Command Center)
  - Blackboard decision/reliability/task-sync projections now recognize orchestrator runtime events (for example `context_pack_built`, planning, task lifecycle, and run failure events), not only context-run `meta_next_step_selected`.
  - Refresh triggers were expanded to these orchestrator event families so blackboard state updates consistently during active runs.
  - Added `task_trace` coverage in projection/refresh/filtering so first-tool/stage details are visible in blackboard rails.
- Filesystem and tool-path reliability hardening
  - Path normalization now rejects synthetic placeholders (for example `files/directories`, `tool/policy`) and recognizes document extensions (`.pdf/.docx/.pptx/.xlsx/.rtf`) when recovering file targets.
  - `read` now returns explicit structured failures (`path_not_found`, `path_is_directory`, `read_text_failed`) instead of silent empty output.
  - Sandbox-denied responses now include actionable diagnostics (`workspace_root`, `effective_cwd`, and suggested in-workspace target path).
  - Windows verbatim paths (`\\?\...`) are accepted when they are still inside workspace root, reducing false sandbox denials.

## v0.3.21 (Unreleased)

- Global storage path standardization
  - Standardized global Tandem storage fallbacks to OS-native app-data roots (`.../tandem`) across engine/runtime/server/channels/skills/core, replacing scattered relative `.tandem` fallbacks for global state.
  - Added `TANDEM_HOME` override support in shared storage path resolution for deterministic custom install roots (servers/CI).
- Registry publish reliability
  - Fixed crates publish ordering so `crates/tandem-agent-teams` is published before `crates/tandem-tools`, preventing crates.io dependency-resolution failures during release runs.

## v0.3.20 - 2026-02-25

- Tandem TUI reliability and workflow upgrade
  - Small pastes (1-2 lines) now insert directly without `[Pasted ...]` markers; CRLF paste payloads are normalized to prevent line-overlap rendering issues.
  - Fixed multiline composer height calculation so explicit newlines grow input height correctly (prevents second-line overlap/cropping).
  - Agent fanout now auto-switches mode from `plan` to `orchestrate` before team delegation to avoid plan-mode approval/clarification blockers.
  - Expanded agent-team fanout integration: coordinated `TeamCreate` + delegated `task` routing, local mailbox/session binding, and teammate alias normalization (`A2`/`a2`/`agent-2`).
- Provider/tool runtime hotfixes for OpenRouter/OpenAI-compatible flows
  - Fixed streaming parser compatibility for providers that emit content/tool calls in `choices[].message` (instead of only `choices[].delta`), eliminating empty assistant replies and missed tool execution in affected sessions.
  - Added explicit default `max_tokens` cap (`2048`, env-overridable via `TANDEM_PROVIDER_MAX_TOKENS`) on OpenAI-compatible requests to prevent accidental high-budget sends (for example `65536`) that can cause 402 Payment Required failures during simple tool prompts.

## v0.3.19

- Stress benchmark parity + reliability upgrade
  - Server-side VPS Stress Lab scenarios (`remote`, `file`, `inline`) now measure true end-to-end async run completion (provider/tool included), not fast submit-path timing.
  - Added explicit provider/model resolution + injection for server-side stress prompt runs so LLM calls are guaranteed in prompt scenarios.
  - Fixed Stress Lab line-chart NaN rendering edge cases on sparse/all-zero series.
- Cross-system comparison support (Tandem vs OpenCode)
  - Added OpenCode benchmark API client wiring in portal (`/results/latest`, `/results/history`, `/results/by-date`, `/health`).
  - Added in-page comparison panel with scenario-mapped deltas (avg/p95 and error context) and 30-day baseline context.
- Engine + diagnostics improvements
  - Added request latency instrumentation for key engine routes: `session.command`, `session.get`, and `session.list`.
  - Improved external benchmark-service compatibility by aligning `/api/v1` health/read routing expectations.
- Tandem TUI reliability and workflow upgrade
  - Upgraded TUI terminal stack to `ratatui 0.30` + `crossterm 0.29` and replaced third-party throbber usage with local spinner rendering.
  - Added safer Windows paste handling with token placeholders to prevent line-by-line replay floods and accidental sends during large pastes.
  - Fixed plan-mode request/question handoff loops that could repeatedly hit `409 session has active run` by queueing follow-up prompts safely when runs are busy.
  - Improved request-center answer handling and visibility with clearer selection behavior and explicit "submitted answers" confirmation.
  - Restored task-list persistence when reopening historical plan sessions by parsing all persisted tool-call variants (`tool`, `tool_call`, `tool_use`).
  - Added sessions list deletion controls (`d`/`Delete`) and explicit `/agent fanout [n]` command to force multi-agent grid fanout (default 4).

## v0.3.18

- Provider model selection hotfix (OpenRouter/API-key env interactions)
  - Fixed env-layer provider bootstrap so setting `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` no longer hard-overrides OpenRouter default model to `openai/gpt-4o-mini`.
  - Preserves configured model choices (for example `z-ai/glm-5`) across engine restarts in VPS/web setups.
  - Model override from env is now explicit-only: applied only when a model env var is set, not just because an API key exists.

## v0.3.17

- Channel reliability and permission bootstrap
  - Channel-created sessions now include practical default permission rules to avoid hidden permission deadlocks.
  - Channel dispatcher now streams events at session scope and parses `message.part.updated` text deltas + additional terminal run variants for more reliable connector replies.
- Telegram diagnostics quality
  - Poll failures now include richer debug context and non-success status/body previews for easier production debugging.
- Portal run-debug quality (limited to observability)
  - Added global pending-approval visibility/action and clearer “no pending” messaging.
  - Web examples now prefer session-level SSE attach plus clearer watchdog trace events to reduce “connected/ready with no deltas” confusion.

## v0.3.16

- AI hotfix: What's New release-note alignment
  - The What's New overlay now fetches release notes by installed app tag from GitHub at runtime.
  - If release-note fetch fails or body text is unavailable, the overlay no longer shows stale bundled notes and instead points users to the latest release page.
- Plan execution task-state integrity
  - **Execute Pending Tasks** now enforces a strict completion contract: task execution is only considered complete when todo statuses are updated via `todowrite`.
  - Assistant text like "all tasks completed" is no longer trusted on its own; mismatches now surface an explicit execution-incomplete error.
  - Execution payload now includes pending-only tasks so the chat prompt and Tasks sidebar stay aligned.

## v0.3.15

- Breaking web tool migration:
  - `webfetch_document` was removed.
  - `webfetch` is now markdown-first and returns structured JSON output by default.
  - Use `webfetch_html` when raw HTML output is explicitly required.
- Custom provider + llama-swap compatibility and diagnostics:
  - Fixed custom provider config propagation so enabled custom endpoints/models are registered in engine runtime config (`providers.custom`) and selected correctly.
  - Fixed OpenAI-compatible endpoint normalization to prevent malformed URLs (for example `/v1/v1/chat/completions`) from trailing/duplicated path input.
  - Added support for custom/non-built-in provider IDs in engine provider registry (prevents fallback to `local`-only configured providers).
  - Added short retry handling for transient connection/timeout provider-call failures.
  - Improved provider error messaging with endpoint + failure category details to make connectivity issues actionable.
- Settings UX improvements for custom providers:
  - Added explicit success/error feedback after clicking **Save Custom Provider**.
  - Updated Anthropic/OpenAI model selection UX to text-input-first with refreshed current model suggestions and clearer placeholders.
- Channel integrations: expanded slash-command control/visibility directly from Telegram/Discord/Slack:
  - `/run` for active run status
  - `/cancel` (and `/abort`) for run cancellation
  - `/todos` for session todo visibility
  - `/requests` to view pending permission/question requests
  - `/answer <question_id> <text>` to reply to pending question prompts
  - `/providers` and `/models [provider]` for provider/model catalog visibility
- Channel integrations: added `/model <model_id>` to switch the active model on the current default provider from chat channels (without adding provider/token switching flows).

## v0.3.14

- AI hotfix: endless update prompt/version skew
  - Desktop now prefers bundled engine binaries when AppData sidecar binaries are stale, preventing false "You have v0.3.0" prompts after upgrading.
  - Engine update overlay version formatting is normalized to avoid duplicated prefixes (for example `vv0.3.12`).

## v0.3.12

- AI hotfix: MCP runtime compatibility
  - Desktop now falls back to `GET /mcp` server `tool_cache` when `GET /mcp/tools` returns `404` on mixed-version engines.
  - Fixes Extensions MCP runtime load failures (`Failed to load MCP runtime`) while older/newer engine components are temporarily out of sync.
- Registry publish hotfix
  - Fixed crates publish ordering/dependency coverage for `tandem-providers`/`tandem-memory` and `tandem-document`/`tandem-tools` dependency chains.

- Issue #14 fix (custom providers + live model lists):
  - Fixed `custom` provider routing so custom endpoint/model selections are honored for chat/automation dispatch.
  - Provider settings now prefer engine-catalog model IDs (OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenCode Zen) when available, instead of static-only dropdown content.
- Updates + release metadata reliability:
  - Settings release notes now fall back to updater `latest.json` when GitHub Releases API is unavailable.
  - Desktop CSP now explicitly allows GitHub release metadata hosts used by updater/release note fetches.
  - Sidecar updater status now reports bundled-engine version from app metadata instead of stale stored beta values.

## v0.3.9 (Unreleased)

- Memory Consolidation: Added opt-in LLM summarization of session memory using the cheapest available configured provider (prioritizing local/free options like Ollama, Groq, OpenRouter). Automatically triggers as a background task when a session completes.
- Channel Tool Policy: Added `channels.tool_policy` config option (`allow_all`, `deny_all`, `require_approval`) and `TANDEM_CHANNEL_TOOL_POLICY` env var to govern agent tool execution in messaging channels.
- Channel Session Metadata: Upgraded channel session tracking to persist detailed `SessionRecord` mapping (timestamps, channel, sender) instead of bare session IDs.
- Headless web admin: Added embedded single-file `/admin` UI served by `tandem-server` (no external runtime assets).
- Realtime admin updates: Added SSE-driven refresh behavior with polling fallback for live admin visibility.
- New channel admin APIs:
  - `GET /channels/status`
  - `PUT /channels/{name}`
  - `DELETE /channels/{name}`
  - `POST /admin/reload-config`
- New memory admin APIs:
  - `GET /memory`
  - `DELETE /memory/{id}`
- Engine CLI: Added `tandem-engine serve --web-ui` and `--web-ui-prefix` (plus env equivalents).
- Runtime wiring: Channel listener lifecycle now integrates with server startup/reload paths for headless operation.
- Security hardening: Embedded admin responses now include strict CSP/security headers.
- Agent Command Center (desktop): Added initial command-center UI in Orchestrator for live agent-team missions/instances/approvals.
- Agent-Team approvals: Added explicit spawn approval decision endpoints (`POST /agent-team/approvals/spawn/{id}/approve|deny`).
- Docs: Updated engine command reference for web admin flags and headless control surface.
- Desktop channels: Fixed a startup race so saved Telegram/Discord/Slack bot-token connections persist correctly across app/engine restarts after vault unlock.
- Model routing: Fixed provider/model dispatch so selected models are used across chat/session/orchestrator flows instead of fallback defaults.
- Model selection persistence: Chat and Command Center now persist explicit `selected_model` routing in provider config.
- Provider runtime behavior: Streaming/completion calls now honor per-request model overrides.
- OpenRouter attribution: Added Tandem-origin headers for provider requests.
- Memory reliability: Added startup backup + self-heal recovery for malformed/incompatible memory vector tables.
- Command Center reliability: Fixed paused/failed status mapping and disabled launch while runs are active.
- Autonomous swarm permissions: Orchestrator/Command Center sessions now auto-allow shell permissions in autonomous mode.
- Shell robustness: Empty shell calls now fail fast with `BASH_COMMAND_MISSING` instead of hanging until timeout.
- Windows compatibility: Added translation for common Unix-style agent shell commands (`ls -la`, `find ... -type f -name ...`) to PowerShell equivalents.
- Stream stability: Reduced false stream watchdog degraded events while tools are still pending.
- Command Center reliability: Added strict `read`/`write` tool-arg validation (JSON object + non-empty `path`) with fail-fast `INVALID_TOOL_ARGS` handling to prevent endless retry loops.
- Orchestrator error clarity: Replaced generic Windows `os error 3` workspace mismatch messaging with structured classification (`WORKSPACE_NOT_FOUND`, path-not-found fail-fast, timeout codes).
- Workspace safety: Task child sessions now pin explicitly to orchestrator workspace path and preflight-check workspace existence before session creation.
- Workspace propagation fix (CC-001): New runs now persist canonical `workspace_root`, and tool executions receive explicit `workspace_root`/`effective_cwd` context so filesystem operations always use the selected workspace.
- Workspace switch hot-reload fix (CC-001): Switching active workspace now invalidates stale orchestrator engines bound to previous roots, preventing agents from reading/writing in old directories.
- Selected Run readability (CC-002): Added objective line-clamp with `Show more` / `Show less` in Command Center Selected Run panel.
- Runs observability (CC-003): Runs list now shows status badges, started/ended timestamps, and failed-run error snippets.
- Tool history integrity: Tool execution IDs now include session/message/part context to avoid cross-session `part_id` collisions in diagnostics.

- Engine memory tools:
  - Added `memory_store` for persisting agent-learned memory in `session`/`project`/`global` tiers.
  - Added `memory_list` for browsing/auditing stored memory by scope/tier.
- Global memory support:
  - `memory_search` now supports `tier=global` with explicit opt-in (`allow_global=true` or `TANDEM_ENABLE_GLOBAL_MEMORY=1`).
  - Global tier remains gated by default to preserve isolation without explicit enablement.
- Engine memory DB alignment:
  - `tandem-engine` now auto-sets `TANDEM_MEMORY_DB_PATH` to shared Tandem `memory.sqlite` when unset so connected apps/tools use the same knowledge base.
- Engine-native OS awareness:
  - Added canonical engine-detected runtime context (`os`, `arch`, `shell_family`, `path_style`) shared across server APIs/events and session metadata.
  - `session.run.started` and `/global/health` now include `environment` metadata for cross-client diagnostics (Desktop, TUI, HTTP clients).
  - `tandem-core` prompt assembly now injects a deterministic `[Execution Environment]` block by default (`TANDEM_OS_AWARE_PROMPTS` toggle).
- Cross-platform shell hardening:
  - Non-Windows shell execution now uses POSIX shell (`sh -lc`) instead of PowerShell fallback.
  - Windows shell guardrails now translate common Unix command patterns, block unsafe untranslatable Unix-only commands, and return structured metadata (`os_guardrail_applied`, `translated_command`, `guardrail_reason`).
  - Added OS/path mismatch classification (`OS_MISMATCH`) and suppression of repeated identical mismatch-prone shell retries.
- Documentation:
  - Added CLI examples for `memory_store`, `memory_list`, and global memory operations.
  - Updated engine README with global memory enablement and shared DB behavior notes.
- Quality:
  - Added/updated tool tests for global-memory opt-in gating and scope validation.
- MCP Automated Agents:
  - Added dedicated `Agent Automation` desktop page (separate from Command Center) for scheduled bots + MCP connector control.

  - Added sidecar compatibility fallback from `/automations` to legacy `/routines` to reduce mixed-version 404 loops.
  - Added automation model-routing controls and presets (OpenRouter/OpenCode Zen examples) and emitted `routine.run.model_selected` events.
  - Hardened automation `model_policy` validation/patch semantics (including clear with `model_policy: {}`).
  - Expanded guide docs for MCP automated agent setup, headless operation, provider onboarding, and release-readiness checklist.
- Contributor thanks:
  - Thanks to [@iridite](https://github.com/iridite) for PR #12 (ProviderCard i18n namespace fix).
  - Thanks for PR #11 (`feat: enhance ReadTool to support document formats`) moving document extraction toward shared engine-side crate usage (`tandem-document`).

## v0.3.7 - 2026-02-18

- TUI auto-recovery: Added `TANDEM_ENGINE_STALE_POLICY` (default `auto_replace`) so stale engines are replaced automatically instead of silently attached.
- TUI port fallback: When stale/default shared port is occupied, TUI now spawns managed engine on an available port.
- TUI diagnostics: `/engine status` now includes required version, active stale policy, and connection source (`shared-attached` or `managed-local`).
- Release alignment: Bumped Rust crates, app manifests, and npm wrapper packages to `0.3.6`.

## v0.3.3 - 2026-02-18

- Agent Teams: Added server-side Agent Teams foundations in `tandem-server` with shared spawn-policy gating across orchestrator/UI/tool entrypoints.

- Security: Added engine API token auth hardening with keychain-first token persistence, desktop masked/reveal/copy controls, and TUI `/engine token` commands.
- Security: Fixed provider key drift by routing auth to runtime-only `/auth/{provider}` handling instead of config-secret persistence.
- Security: `PATCH /config` and `PATCH /global/config` now reject `api_key`/`apiKey` fields with `400 CONFIG_SECRET_REJECTED`.
- Security: TUI and desktop now sync provider keys from keystore to runtime auth (`/auth`) instead of writing keys through config patches.
- Security: Fixed a beta regression where provider keys could appear in plaintext in Tandem config files in specific config-patch flows.
- Networking: Added CORS handling to engine HTTP routes for browser clients using custom auth headers (`X-Tandem-Token`).

- Plan Mode: Fixed `todowrite` empty-argument loops (`todo list updated: 0 items`) by normalizing common todo payload shapes and skipping true empty calls.
- Plan Mode: Added structured clarification fallback (`question.asked`) when no concrete task list can be produced, instead of leaving planning in prose-only follow-up.
- Plan Mode: Tightened todo fallback extraction to structured checklist/numbered lines only, preventing plain-text clarification prose from becoming phantom tasks.
- Desktop UX: Restored walkthrough-question overlays when prompts arrive via `permission(tool=question)` by normalizing into the question modal flow.
- Desktop UX: Scoped permission prompts to the active session to prevent cross-session/parallel-client approval bleed.
- TUI Startup: Engine bootstrap now runs before PIN entry, keeping startup on the matrix/connect screen until engine availability is confirmed.
- Engine Networking: Default engine port standardized to `39731` (instead of `3000`) to reduce frontend port conflicts; desktop/TUI honor env overrides for endpoint selection.
- TUI Download UX: Added byte-based download progress, install-phase messaging, and surfaced last download error details in the connect view.

- Skills: Template installer now copies the full template directory (including `references/`, scripts, and assets), not only `SKILL.md`.
- Skills: Fixed starter-template parsing issues caused by UTF-8 BOM in `SKILL.md` files (`missing or malformed frontmatter`).
- Skills: Fixed invalid YAML `tags` in `development-estimation` and `mode-builder`.
- Skills UI: Prioritized canonical marketing skills over legacy/fallback marketing templates in recommendations.
- Marketing workflow: Replaced `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` references with `scripts/marketing/_shared/product-marketing-context.md` and bundled shared context templates.
- Docs: Added canonical no-duplicate routing map at `docs/marketing_skill_canonical_map.md`.
- Release: Bumped version metadata to `0.2.25` across app manifests.

## v0.2.24 (2026-02-12)

- Modes: Added full custom modes MVP across backend + frontend with server-side enforcement and safe fallbacks.
- Modes UI: Added `Extensions -> Modes` with two views:
  - Guided Builder (recommended)
  - Advanced Editor
- Guided Builder: Added step-by-step mode creation for non-technical users, including preview-before-apply.
- AI Assist: Added optional AI-assisted mode creation flow with a bundled `mode-builder` skill template and paste-and-parse JSON preview.
- Mode Icons: Added icon selection for custom modes and icon rendering in the chat mode selector.
- Mode Selector: Switched to dynamic mode list (built-in + custom) with compact custom-mode descriptions.
- Memory: Auto-index on project load now defaults to enabled (`true`) for new settings state.
- Updates: Fixed version metadata mismatches by syncing `tauri.conf.json`, `package.json`, and `Cargo.toml` so auto-updates detect new releases correctly.

## v0.2.22 (2026-02-11)

- Orchestrator: Fixed a cross-project state bug where opening Orchestrator could load an old completed run from another project.
- Orchestrator: Switching projects (or adding/activating a project) now clears stale orchestrator run selection so each workspace starts clean.
- Orchestrator: Auto-selection now resumes only active runs (`planning`, `awaiting_approval`, `executing`, `paused`) and no longer auto-opens terminal history (`completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`).

## v0.2.21 (2026-02-11)

- Model selector UX: Replaced horizontal provider chips with a compact provider dropdown (`All` + visible providers) to scale cleanly when many providers are available.
- Model selector search: Added provider-aware query syntax via `provider:<id-or-name>` (for example `provider:openrouter sonnet`) while keeping normal model name/id search.
- Model selector clarity: Added inline context text ("Showing configured providers + local") so hidden-provider behavior is explicit.
- Model selector reliability: Provider filter now safely resets to `All` if the selected provider disappears after catalog refresh.
- Empty states: Model dropdown now reports provider-specific no-match states (for example "No models found for OpenRouter").
- Files: Fixed fullscreen file preview readability by using a stronger, opaque surface backdrop so text no longer blends into transparent/gradient themes.

## v0.2.20 (2026-02-11)

- Sidecar updates: Switched OpenCode release discovery to paginated GitHub Releases metadata (`per_page=20` + additional pages), avoiding fragile single-endpoint latest behavior.
- Sidecar updates: Selects the newest compatible release for the current platform/arch by filtering release assets, skipping drafts, and excluding prereleases unless beta channel is enabled.
- Sidecar updates: Added API-efficiency protections (ETag/Last-Modified conditional requests, local cache reuse, and debounce window) to reduce rate-limit pressure and improve resilience.
- Sidecar updates: Improved version comparison with semantic version parsing to avoid incorrect prompts caused by string comparison.
- UI/Status: Added compatibility-aware sidecar status fields (`latestOverallVersion`, `compatibilityMessage`) and improved overlay messaging when latest overall and latest compatible differ.
- **Console & Chat UI Fixes**: Resolved an issue where the Console tab would lose history when switching views or restarting the drawer. Also fixed the "Jump to latest" button positioning to ensure it stays pinned to the bottom of the chat.
- **Streaming Architecture Uplift**: Added a global stream hub with a single long-lived sidecar subscription and fanout to chat, orchestrator, and Ralph.
- **Event Envelope v2**: Added additive `sidecar_event_v2` envelopes (`event_id`, `correlation_id`, `ts_ms`, `session_id`, `source`, `payload`) while preserving legacy `sidecar_event`.
- **Stream Health Visibility**: Added explicit stream health signaling (`healthy`, `degraded`, `recovering`) and surfaced status in chat.
- **Duplicate/Race Reduction**: Refactored `send_message_streaming` to send-only and moved event relay responsibility to the global stream hub.
- **Reliable Frontend Reconciliation**: Added frontend stream dedupe keyed by `event_id` and wired missing `memory_retrieval` event handling.
- **Busy-Agent Queue UX**: Added message queue support while generation is active (enqueue on Enter + queue preview with send-next/send-all/remove).
- **Process Summary UX**: Upgraded assistant tool-call summary cards with compact process status, step counts, running/pending/failed counts, and duration.
- **Skills Lifecycle Upgrade**: Added import preview + apply flow for SKILL.md/zip packs with deterministic conflict policies (`skip`, `overwrite`, `rename`).
- **Skills Metadata Expansion**: Surfaced richer skill metadata (`version`, `author`, `tags`, `requires`, `compatibility`, `triggers`) and better invalid-skill parse feedback.

## v0.2.19 (2026-02-11)

- Memory: Chat now runs vector retrieval in both standard and streaming send paths, injects `<memory_context>` when relevant, and emits verifiable retrieval telemetry events.
- Memory: Assistant responses now include a colored memory capsule with a brain icon (`used/not used`, chunk count, latency) so retrieval usage is visible per response.
- Logs: Memory retrieval logs now use a distinct `tandem.memory` signal with structured fields (status, chunk tier counts, latency, score range, short query hash) and no raw prompt/chunk content.
- Logs/Console: Reworked Logs drawer tabs to focus on Tandem logs + Console activity (removed redundant OC sidecar tab in this view).
- UI: Logs drawer fullscreen now uses dynamic height correctly instead of staying constrained to the initial panel height.
- Stability: Sidecar lifecycle start/stop is serialized to prevent duplicate OpenCode/Bun instances from race conditions.
- Theme: Improved Pink Pony readability by increasing contrast and reducing problematic translucency.

## v0.2.18 (2026-02-10)

- Files (WIP): Attempted auto-refresh of the Files tree when tools/AI create new files, but it is still unreliable and needs deeper investigation. For now, you may need to switch away and back to Files to see new items.
- Files: File preview now supports a dock mount + fullscreen toggle.
- Python: Enforce venv-only python/pip usage across tool approval and staged/batch execution paths.
- Python: When Python is blocked by venv policy, Tandem auto-opens the Python Setup (Workspace Venv) wizard.
- Packs (Python): Add `requirements.txt` and update START_HERE docs to install dependencies into the workspace venv (no global `pip install`).
- Dev: Add a "Python Packs Standard" to `CONTRIBUTING.md` and ship pack-level `CONTRIBUTING.md` where relevant.

## v0.2.17 (2026-02-10)

- Backgrounds: Fix opacity slider flashing/disappearing in some packaged builds by keeping the resolved image URL stable and updating only opacity.
- Backgrounds: Render custom background image as a dedicated fixed layer for more reliable stacking across views.

## v0.2.16 (2026-02-10)

- Updates: Fix the in-app update prompt layout being constrained/squished due to theme background layering CSS.

## v0.2.15 (2026-02-10)

- Backgrounds: Fix custom background images failing to load in some packaged builds by falling back to an in-memory `data:` URL when the `asset:` URL fails.

## v0.2.14 (2026-02-10)

- Themes: Cosmic Glass now has a denser starfield + galaxy glow background.
- Themes: Pink Pony now features a thick, arcing rainbow background.
- Themes: Zen Dusk now uses a minimalist ink + sage haze background.
- Backgrounds: Add an optional custom background image overlay (copied into app data) with an opacity slider in Settings.
- UI: Gradient theme backgrounds now render consistently across main views and overlays (fixes occasional overlay "shine through").
- Sessions: Fix restored sessions appearing selected but not opening until reselecting the folder (defer history load until the sidecar is running; allow re-clicking the selected session to reload).
- Files: Add Rust-based text extraction for common document formats (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX/XLS/ODS/XLSB, RTF) via `read_file_text`, so these attachments can be previewed and included as usable text in skills/chats without requiring Python.
- Python: Add a workspace-scoped venv wizard (creates `.opencode/.venv` and installs requirements into it) and enforce venv-only python/pip usage for AI tool calls to prevent global installs.
- Navigation: Restore Settings/About/Extensions views after a regression where they would not appear.
- Packs: Style runtime requirement pills consistently.

## v0.2.13 (2026-02-10)

- Skills: Add two new bundled starter skills: `brainstorming` and `development-estimation`.
- Skills: Show runtime requirement pills on starter skill cards via optional `requires: [...]` YAML frontmatter.
- Skills: Improve Skills install/manage UX (runtime note, clearer installed-skill counts, and jump-to-installed).
- Packs: Packs page now shows packs only (remove starter skills section) and moves the runtime note to the top.
- Diagnostics: Improve Logs viewer UX (fullscreen + copy feedback); fix an invalid bundled skill template frontmatter that was being skipped.
- Dev: In `tauri dev`, load starter skill templates from `src-tauri/resources/skill-templates/` so newly added templates appear immediately.
- Docs: Add a developer guide for adding skills in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## v0.2.12 (2026-02-09)

- Orchestrator: Persist the selected provider/model on runs and prefer it when sending prompts, so runs don't start without an explicit model spec.
- Orchestrator: Prevent empty plans from being treated as "Completed"; make Restart rerun completed plans and re-plan when needed.
- Orchestrator: Allow deleting orchestrator runs from the Sessions sidebar (removes the run from disk and deletes its backing OpenCode session).
- Diagnostics: Improve in-app Logs drawer sharing UX (horizontal scroll for long lines, selected-line preview, and copy helpers).
- Release: Fix Discord release notifications for automated releases (publish via `GITHUB_TOKEN` doesn't trigger `release: published` workflows).

## v0.2.11 (2026-02-09)

- OpenCode: Prevent sessions from getting stuck indefinitely when a tool invocation never reaches a terminal state (ignore heartbeat/diff noise, treat more tool terminal statuses as `ToolEnd`, and add a fail-fast timeout that cancels the request and surfaces an error).
- Diagnostics: Add an on-demand Logs drawer that can tail Tandem app logs and show OpenCode sidecar stdout/stderr (captured into a bounded in-memory buffer). Streaming only runs while the viewer is open.
- Reliability: Ignore OpenCode `server.*` heartbeat SSE events (and downgrade other unknown SSE events) to prevent warning spam in logs.
- Providers: Add Poe as an OpenAI-compatible provider option (endpoint + `POE_API_KEY`). Thanks [@CamNoob](https://github.com/CamNoob).
- Release: Retry GitHub Release asset uploads to reduce flakes during transient GitHub errors.

## v0.2.10 (Failed Release, 2026-02-09)

- Release attempt failed due to GitHub release asset upload errors during a GitHub incident; no assets were published. v0.2.11 re-cuts the same changes.

## v0.2.9 (2026-02-09)

- Memory: Incremental per-project workspace file indexing with percent progress, auto-index toggle, and a "Clear File Index" action to reclaim space.
- Memory: Vector Database Stats now supports All Projects vs Active Project scope.
- OpenCode: Properly handle question prompts (multi-question wizard with multiple-choice + custom answers).
- Sessions: On startup, automatically load session history for the last active folder (fixes empty sidebar until a manual refresh).
- Windows: Prevent orphaned OpenCode sidecar (and Bun) processes during `pnpm tauri dev` rebuilds by attaching the sidecar to a Job Object (kill-on-close).

## v0.2.8 (2026-02-09)

- Support multiple custom OpenCode providers by name: Tandem now lets you select arbitrary providers from the sidecar catalog (not just the built-in list) and persists the selection for routing.

## v0.2.7 (2026-02-08)

- Fix OpenCode config writes so existing `opencode.json` is not deleted if replacement fails (Windows-safe).
- Reduce sidecar idle memory usage with Bun/JSC environment hints.

## v0.2.6 (2026-02-08)

- Fix macOS release builds by disabling signing/notarization by default (can be enabled via `MACOS_SIGNING_ENABLED=true`).

## v0.2.5 (2026-02-08)

- Re-cut release to ensure CI/release builds run with the corrected GitHub Actions workflow.

## v0.2.4 (2026-02-08)

- Fixed Starter Pack installs failing in packaged builds (bundled resource path resolution).
- Fixed onboarding getting stuck for Custom providers (e.g. LM Studio) and bouncing users back to Settings.
- Added Vector DB stats + manual workspace indexing in Settings.
- Improved macOS release workflow with optional signing/notarization inputs and CI Gatekeeper verification.

## v0.2.3 (2026-02-08)

- Fixed Orchestration Mode creating endless new root chat sessions during execution.
