# Release Notes

This is the canonical release-notes file used by release tooling.

## v0.5.4 (Released 2026-05-05)

This patch fixes automation schedule timezone handling, tightens the distinction between local source-code research and final research synthesis, and introduces marketplace-ready workflow pack import/export.

Automation cron schedules now preserve the selected local wall-clock time end to end. The server accepts the 5-field cron expressions emitted by the control panel, normalizes them for the Rust cron parser, and evaluates them in the saved IANA timezone when computing `next_fire_at_ms`. The control panel now carries that timezone through guided schedule summaries, creation review, workflow editing, calendar labels, and standup scheduling, with `Europe/Budapest` available in the common timezone picker. A regression test covers weekday 9:00 AM in Budapest resolving correctly through DST-aware UTC storage.

Final report/brief nodes that synthesize already-collected Tandem MCP notes, Reddit MCP signals, web findings, and run artifacts no longer require fresh workspace `read` calls. The planner stops adding `local_source_reads` to new `research_synthesis` contracts, and the runtime validator waives stale local-read enforcement on existing saved synthesis nodes. Code-change, local-research, and Bug Monitor source-inspection nodes still retain their strict repo-read gates.

This prevents research-to-destination workflows from blocking with messages such as `research brief cited workspace sources without using read` when the workflow only cites MCP/web/upstream artifact evidence and does not need repository source files.

Workflow packs are now the preferred portable format for created workflows. The Workflows page can upload a `.zip` pack, preview its manifest, cover image, workflow entries, capabilities, and validation results, then install it and open the resulting planner session. Raw JSON workflow bundle import remains available under Advanced for debugging and internal handoffs.

Planner sessions can also be exported as marketplace-ready workflow pack ZIPs containing `tandempack.yaml`, `README.md`, the embedded workflow plan bundle, and an optional PNG/JPEG/WebP cover image. New workflow-pack APIs and TypeScript client helpers support export, preview, and import, while imported sessions keep pack provenance (`source_pack_id`, version, and source bundle digest) for later inspection.

Exported workflow packs now include a hosted-safe download URL, and the Workflows page shows a browser Download ZIP action after export so operators can retrieve generated packs without access to the server filesystem path. Control-panel uploads also now prefer `$TANDEM_HOME/data/channel_uploads` and expand home-directory placeholders such as `~`, `$HOME`, `${HOME}`, and `%HOME%`, avoiding stray literal upload directories when hosted or Windows-style environment values are used on Linux/macOS.

## v0.5.3 (Released 2026-05-03)

Automation V2 workflow definitions now use per-workflow storage shards. Instead of rewriting every saved workflow into one large `automations_v2.json` file, Tandem writes each definition to `data/automations-v2/<automation-id>.json` and keeps a small `index.json` alongside the shards. On startup, existing aggregate installs are migrated automatically and the old aggregate is preserved as `automations_v2.legacy-aggregate.json` for rollback/debugging.

Generated workflow planning now has a deterministic 8-task budget for AI-created plans. If the model returns a large valid graph, Tandem compacts it into request-aware macro steps before preview or revision storage, preserving tool/source intent, Notion collection ids, required report sections, and delivery/verification details. Apply and planner-session boundaries reject uncompacted oversized generated plans with `WORKFLOW_PLAN_TASK_BUDGET_EXCEEDED`, while manual Workflow Studio plans and explicit imports remain exempt. The control panel shows the compaction outcome directly in planner diagnostics.

Connector-backed generated workflow nodes also route MCP tools more reliably. Natural objectives like “Use the connected Reddit MCP” now match hyphenated server ids such as `reddit-gmail`, so Reddit research nodes are offered `mcp.reddit_gmail.*` tools instead of only discovering them through `mcp_list`. Artifact guidance now treats connector gaps as limitation metadata while keeping completed JSON artifacts terminal, preventing `status: blocked` artifacts from tripping `artifact_status_not_terminal` and blocking Bug Monitor or downstream workflow reporting.

## v0.5.2 (Released 2026-05-03)

This patch hardens the demo-critical workflow and Bug Monitor loop.

Bug Monitor triage now treats local source reads as advisory evidence for its own artifacts instead of a hard publication gate. Triage still asks agents to search inside the configured `workspace_root` and prefer concrete source-file reads, but if reads are unavailable or inconclusive, Bug Monitor preserves the search evidence, limitations, uncertainty, and original workflow failure in completed JSON. This prevents recursive `no_concrete_reads` failures from masking the real incident.

Blocked Automation V2-backed Bug Monitor triage runs are now treated as terminal enough for fallback summary synthesis and GitHub publication. A failed triage workflow can still generate a GitHub issue pointing at the original workflow failure, including node id, timeout budget, repo/workspace context, and available tool evidence.

Generated workflow planning is less explosive for concise research/report/save requests. Prompts such as "research this topic, create a concise market brief, and save it to Notion" now get a compact 5-8 task budget, bundle report sections into one synthesis step, avoid invented approval gates unless requested, and fall back to a compact plan if the planner emits an oversized graph.

External connector/data-source inspection nodes also get the long-running workflow timeout budget. Structured JSON nodes that inspect or fetch Notion collections, Reddit discussions, or web research no longer default to the generic 180-second timeout, reducing premature failures such as `inspect_notion_collection timed out after 180000 ms`.

## v0.5.1 (Released 2026-05-03)

This release adds the first engine-native Bug Monitor intake path for external projects.

Bug Monitor can now watch configured local project log files without running a workflow. A monitored project declares its repo, workspace root, and log sources; the engine tails new bytes with persisted offsets, parses JSON-lines and plaintext stack traces deterministically, redacts sensitive snippets, writes state-managed evidence artifacts, and creates normal Bug Monitor incidents with `tandem://bug-monitor/...` evidence refs. The watcher starts with the server and reports per-source health, offsets, last poll/candidate/submission timestamps, and errors through Bug Monitor status.

External systems can also report failures through a scoped intake API instead of the full engine token. `POST /bug-monitor/intake/report` and `/failure-reporter/intake/report` accept reports authenticated by per-project intake keys. Keys are hash-stored, scoped to `bug_monitor:report`, cannot override the configured repo/workspace/model/MCP routing, and cannot authorize config changes, issue publishing, workflow execution, tools, or arbitrary file reads. Protected admin endpoints can create, list, and disable intake keys; raw keys are returned only at creation.

Triage routing is now project-aware for these external incidents. Bug Monitor triage prefers the linked incident or monitored project workspace, model policy, and MCP server before falling back to the global Bug Monitor config, so external project failures are inspected in the correct repository context. Existing single-project Bug Monitor config remains compatible.

Bug Monitor triage also now passes the resolved `workspace_root` into every Automation V2 triage node as explicit node input. Research guidance tells the agent to search inside that repo root and then call `read` on at least one concrete source file before finalizing, with an extra repair attempt when the required read evidence is missing. This prevents search-only triage attempts from blocking issue publication with `no_concrete_reads` after the repo has already been synced.

The hosted control-panel setup flow now explains where source checkouts live. Coder sync hints and Bug Monitor settings point operators to `/workspace/repos/<repo-name>`, warn when they select `/workspace/repos`, `/workspace/aca/repos`, or `/workspace/tandem-data`, and show a ready state when the selected directory looks like the source checkout Bug Monitor should inspect.

## v0.5.0 (Released 2026-05-03)

- **Bug Monitor GitHub fallback issue-body hardening**: fallback rendering now includes bounded evidence from existing incident/draft records when triage output is missing (timeouts, triage failures, or publish races). Logs and evidence refs are capped to keep GitHub posts readable; a short triage status marker (`triage_timed_out`, `triage_pending`, `github_post_failed`) is preserved for quicker human triage.
- **Bug Monitor triage now runs on Automation V2**: triage is no longer an orphaned context run that can sit forever in `Planning`. It now launches an Automation V2 run with inspect, research, validation, and fix-proposal nodes, and stores completed node handoffs in the global Bug Monitor context-run artifacts used for issue drafting.
- **Triage reruns now recover from stale Automation V2 definitions**: If an existing triage run reused from older code still has legacy output-contract settings, Bug Monitor now recreates that triage run with corrected contracts before trying to reuse it.
- **Legacy bug-monitor inspection enforcement is now resilient**: Inspection nodes from persisted triage runs are protected from legacy `read`/concrete-read enforcement so they no longer trip `no_concrete_reads` or `local_source_reads` gates when running under the updated triage model.
- **Completed triage no longer stalls in drafts**: when Automation V2-backed triage completes, Bug Monitor now finalizes the triage summary, regenerates the issue draft, and retries the normal GitHub publish path instead of leaving the draft stuck at `triage_pending`.
- **Triage artifacts now require repo evidence**: Bug Monitor triage prompts require local `codesearch`/`grep`/`glob`/`read` evidence before producing artifacts, including searched terms, files examined, file references, likely edit points, affected components, uncertainty, and bounded next steps where available.
- **Automation V2 denylisted tools stay denied**: node tool policies now filter denylisted tools after allowlist expansion, preventing research/read-only nodes from being offered source-editing tools that the workflow explicitly blocked.
- **Workflow artifact writes now match the prompt contract**: node `metadata.artifacts` are now allowed by the session write policy, so nodes asked to create files such as `article-thesis.md`, `blog-draft.md`, or `blog-package.md` are not blocked with “no declared output targets.”
- **MCP policy names are less brittle**: missing or renamed policy-selected MCP server names are treated as stale configuration warnings instead of fatal preflight blockers, while disconnected/disabled existing servers still fail fast. The node can discover currently available tools through `mcp_list` rather than being trapped by an old server name.
- **Bug Monitor triage artifacts are global, not workspace-required**: Bug Monitor triage nodes now return structured JSON handoffs that Tandem stores in the global context-run artifact store. Project workspaces remain evidence sources, but missing `.tandem/runs/<run_id>/artifacts/bug_monitor.*.json` files no longer block triage or mask the real workflow failure.
- **Bug Monitor timeout reports preserve the real workflow failure**: deterministic fallback triage now recognizes `automation node \`...\` timed out after ... ms`, keeps the node id and timeout budget in the generated summary/issue draft, and recommends fixing the target workflow timeout/stall instead of presenting a vague Bug Monitor triage failure. The env fallback for Bug Monitor triage timeout also now matches the documented 30-minute budget.
- **Generated workflow execute steps get enough time to work**: workflow `execute` / `execute_goal` nodes now materialize with a 30-minute timeout, and legacy saved `execute_goal` nodes without explicit `timeout_ms` inherit the same long-running budget instead of the generic 3-minute structured-JSON default. Operators can override the default with `TANDEM_AUTOMATION_EXECUTE_NODE_TIMEOUT_MS`.
- **Coder is the shared GUI surface for repository work**: the control panel now labels the former Coding surface as Coder and shows ACA-supervised Coder runs with status, phase, errors, reconcile, and cancel actions through the existing ACA proxy.
- **Concrete MCP tool contention is serialized**: Automation V2 avoids scheduling runnable nodes in parallel when they require the same explicit concrete `mcp.*` tool, reducing duplicate connector calls and external issue/comment spam.
- **Operational doc added**: added `docs/BUG_MONITOR_FALLBACK_GITHUB_POSTING.md` with the fallback body policy, source fields, truncation controls, and triage troubleshooting guidance.
- **Managed worktree cleanup tools**: Tandem now includes a dedicated stale-worktree cleanup endpoint, a `tandem doctor worktrees` CLI path, TypeScript/Python SDK helpers, and a `Settings -> Maintenance` UI that previews and removes leaked repo-local `.tandem/worktrees` entries, deletes associated managed branches when possible, removes orphaned directories, and shows an animated per-item cleanup log so operators can see exactly what was scanned, skipped, removed, or failed.

This major release reorganizes Tandem's local storage so large runtime histories stop accumulating as huge root-level JSON files, and so startup no longer pays the cost of browser setup or stale legacy scans.

### Storage cleanup and migration

The engine now includes a storage maintenance CLI:

- `tandem-engine storage doctor`
- `tandem-engine storage cleanup --dry-run --json`
- `tandem-engine storage cleanup --root-json --context-runs --quarantine --json`

Root-level feature files now have canonical homes under `data/`, including MCP registry, channel sessions/preferences, routines and routine runs, Bug Monitor records, external actions, pack-builder state, shared resources, and workflow-planner sessions. The server reads canonical files first and falls back to legacy root files during migration, so cleanup can be staged safely.

Automation V2 run history now uses a two-tier shape: a small hot index for active/recent summaries and immutable per-run history shards under `data/automation-runs/YYYY/MM/`. Terminal and stale runs drop large node outputs and runtime context from the hot file while detailed run inspection can hydrate from the shard.

Context runs now follow the same principle. Active runs live under `data/context-runs/hot`; old terminal or stale non-terminal runs can be archived as per-run `.tar.gz` files under `data/context-runs/archive/YYYY/MM/`, with monthly JSONL archive indexes and a compact hot index.

### Faster startup

Browser tool registration no longer blocks the engine-ready path. Tandem does not launch Chrome as part of ordinary startup anymore; browser initialization is deferred until browser-backed task execution actually needs it.

Startup paths also prefer canonical storage files and avoid treating stale legacy root JSON as the primary source of truth. This reduces the boot-time cost from old automation, workflow, and Bug Monitor state while preserving fallback reads for migration.

The control panel's provider settings now load more lazily too: the Providers section opens expanded by default, and live model discovery only runs when a section needs it and the provider actually has usable credentials. Providers that need an API key are skipped until a key is present, so Settings no longer waits on discovery calls that cannot succeed yet.

### Operator workflow updates

`docs/ENGINE_TESTING.md` now documents the safer local deploy sequence with `sudo systemctl stop tandem-engine` before building and installing. Its cleanup examples use the installed service binary explicitly for developer machines where another `tandem-engine` shim appears earlier on `PATH`; normal users can continue to run `tandem-engine storage ...`.

The TypeScript and Python SDKs now expose `client.storage` helpers for storage file inspection and the legacy session-storage repair scan. Cleanup and archive migration remain CLI maintenance commands, and the new guide page explains that split so agents do not try to mutate local storage through workflow nodes.

Bug Monitor GitHub readiness now reconnects and refreshes selected MCP servers before reporting GitHub unavailable after an engine restart, reducing false disconnected states during local repair and release testing.

## v0.4.45 (Released 2026-04-28)

This release makes Bug Monitor usable as an operator-facing issue reporter, upgrades workflow failure triage, and significantly improves control-panel rendering performance on data-heavy pages.

### Control-panel rendering performance

Pages that display large JSON payloads — Run Debugger, Scope Inspector, Orchestrator task artifacts, Feed event details, Dashboard workflow context drawer, Coding Workflows blackboard panel, and Packs manifest/step config — were serializing entire objects on every React render cycle, causing visible lag during live runs and on pages with many items.

Serialization is now deferred: payloads are hidden behind `<details>` toggles rendered by a new `LazyJson` component that only calls `JSON.stringify` when the user opens the toggle. Per-row entries inside existing `<details>` elements (receipt timeline, run history events, telemetry events, artifact JSON) use a companion `DeferredJson` component that skips serialization until the parent section is open.

The blackboard query — the single heaviest fetch at 1+ MB every 5 seconds — no longer polls on a fixed interval. It is now invalidated on-demand from SSE events when the blackboard actually changes. Other context queries drop from a 5-second to a 30-second safety-net interval. SSE state updates are batched via `requestAnimationFrame` so high-frequency live-log events coalesce into one React state update per animation frame instead of one per event.

### Bug Monitor is now a real control-panel surface

The control panel now includes a dedicated `#/bug-monitor` page. It shows Bug Monitor readiness and runtime state, including whether monitoring is enabled, active, paused, ingest-ready, publish-ready, and whether pending incidents exist. Operators can refresh status, recompute readiness, pause or resume monitoring, and run the debug endpoint directly from the page.

The same page lists incidents, issue drafts, and published posts using the existing Bug Monitor API and TypeScript SDK namespace. Incident cards expose replay and triage-run actions. Draft cards expose view, approve, deny, triage run, triage summary, issue draft, publish, and recheck actions. A manual report form lets operators submit a flexible Bug Monitor report with title, body, severity, source, labels, related workflow/run IDs, affected path, reproduction notes, expected behavior, and actual behavior.

Incident, draft, and post cards now expose the signal lifecycle directly: signal, draft, triage run, proposal state, coder-ready state, approval state, published output, artifacts, and memory references are shown when the backend provides them. The page also labels locally inferred quality checks as heuristic so operators can tell the difference between backend gate reports and UI fallback inspection.

The `bug-monitor` route is now wired through the hash router instead of falling back to Dashboard, and ACA-mode navigation exposes it by default. Existing Bug Monitor status pills continue to open the Bug Monitor page.

### Workflow failures now produce richer Bug Monitor incidents

Terminal automation and workflow failures now emit Bug Monitor candidate events with enough context to debug the failure: workflow/run/task/stage IDs, automation/routine/session IDs, agent role, retry exhaustion, attempt counts, status, reason, error kind, expected and actual output, tool name, artifact refs, files touched, validation errors, and suggested next action.

The event-to-submission builder now extracts those fields defensively from both snake_case and camelCase payloads. Incident titles are more specific, for example `Workflow feature-archaeology failed at publish_issues: GitHub create issue failed with 422`, and details are structured into sections for event type, repo/workspace, identifiers, component/agent, attempts, error kind, reason, expected/actual output, tool context, artifacts, files, suggested next action, and a redacted payload excerpt. Secret-looking keys are redacted before payload details land in Bug Monitor output.

Bug Monitor candidate detection also covers additional terminal/actionable event names such as automation, context-run, validation, blocked-task, and coder failures while continuing to ignore progress/retry noise.

### Signal quality gates reduce noise before work is created

Bug Monitor now records signal-quality metadata on incidents, drafts, and posts: confidence, risk level, expected destination, evidence refs, and the backend quality-gate report. Manual reports can submit those fields directly, and runtime failure submissions receive conservative defaults when the event payload is terminal and actionable.

The intake path now evaluates whether a signal has a known source, classified type, recorded confidence, fingerprint/dedupe check, evidence or artifact refs, clear destination, known risk level, and is not routine progress or a minor retry. Signals that fail this intake gate are not turned into issue drafts. They are persisted as `quality_gate_blocked` incidents with the gate report attached, so operators can still see what was observed and why it did not advance.

The TypeScript SDK public and wire types now expose the same metadata for Bug Monitor records, which lets the control panel and downstream tools render quality state without depending on raw JSON.

### Triage now researches before drafting issues

Bug Monitor triage runs now seed four tasks instead of two:

- Inspect failure report and affected area
- Research likely root cause and related failures
- Validate or reproduce failure scope
- Propose fix and verification plan

The research task is explicitly asked to search the local repo, failure-pattern memory, existing GitHub issues when available, duplicate matches, artifacts/logs, and external sources when the failure appears to involve a dependency, framework, provider, or API. The validation task classifies the failure type and gathers evidence without destructive actions. The fix-proposal task produces suspected root cause, likely files to edit, recommended fix, acceptance criteria, smoke tests, coder-readiness, labels, and risk level.

Triage runs now write these artifacts into the context run:

- `artifacts/bug_monitor.inspection.json`
- `artifacts/bug_monitor.research.json`
- `artifacts/bug_monitor.validation.json`
- `artifacts/bug_monitor.fix_proposal.json`
- `artifacts/bug_monitor.triage_summary.json`

Completed triage summaries also feed governed memory. Bug Monitor writes failure-pattern memory and regression-signal memory with artifact refs, recurrence counts, linked issue numbers, and duplicate context so future failures can be deduped or researched against prior evidence.

### Proposals and coder handoffs are gated

Bug Monitor no longer treats the initial placeholder triage summary as a GitHub-ready proposal. Issue draft generation now runs a draft-to-proposal quality gate that requires durable triage artifacts, research where needed, validation scope, explicit uncertainty, a bounded recommended action, acceptance criteria, and verification steps. If the gate fails, Tandem writes a `bug_monitor_proposal_quality_gate` artifact, marks the draft `proposal_blocked`, and returns the gate report instead of generating a weak issue.

Coder-ready handoff is gated separately. A triage summary can request `coder_ready`, but Tandem only grants it when root-cause confidence is high or medium, likely files or components are identified, acceptance criteria and verification steps are clear, risk is low or medium, the issue is not a duplicate, and required permissions/tool scopes are available. Missing tool scopes or `permissions_available: false` block coder-ready status and suppress the hidden autonomous-coder handoff block.

### GitHub issue drafts carry coder handoff metadata

Bug Monitor issue drafts now include sections for what happened, expected behavior, steps to reproduce, environment, logs/artifacts, suspected root cause, recommended fix, files likely involved, acceptance criteria, and verification steps. When triage confidence is high or medium, likely files are identified, acceptance criteria and verification steps are clear, and the fix is not broad/high-risk product judgment, the rendered issue includes a hidden Tandem coder handoff block with repo, triage run, workflow run, incident, draft, failure type, likely files, acceptance criteria, verification steps, risk level, and `coder_ready`.

Duplicate failure-pattern context is also preserved through triage replay, recheck, publish-failure responses, and generated issue drafts, so recurring failures point back to prior evidence rather than losing the duplicate match after the first triage run.

### Automation failure reporting is safer and less noisy

Automation V2 connector setup now fails fast when a policy-selected MCP server cannot actually be used. Before launching the agent, Tandem connects required MCP servers, syncs their tools, and verifies that each policy-selected server registered at least one tool. If a required connector such as GitHub is disconnected or syncs zero tools, the node returns `tool_resolution_failed` with MCP diagnostics instead of running a long session that cannot satisfy its tool requirements.

Bug Monitor and Automation V2 now also self-heal common post-restart MCP state. Bug Monitor status recompute attempts to reconnect the selected MCP server before declaring it disconnected, and Automation V2 preflight retries selected MCP connections briefly before failing closed. This removes the manual refresh step for connectors that are configured correctly but whose runtime connection cache starts cold after a restart.

Repository-scope discovery nodes now have a deterministic fast path. When a node is only confirming workspace paths and producing a run artifact, Tandem checks the local files directly, records present and missing paths plus source excerpts, and writes the required artifact without waiting on a provider stream. This prevents the first “assess repository scope” step from sitting silent for minutes before the stale-run reaper pauses it.

Concrete MCP bridge calls now self-heal the same disconnected-runtime state at execution time. If an enabled remote MCP server has registered tools but is marked disconnected when a concrete tool such as `mcp.githubcopilot.get_me` runs, Tandem reconnects and refreshes the server before issuing `tools/call`. This closes the observed gap where `mcp_list` could show GitHub tools but the first concrete GitHub call failed with `MCP server 'githubcopilot' is not connected`.

Automation artifact nodes now run with an engine-enforced write policy. Non-code workflow nodes can only write declared output targets and approved must-write files, while explicit code workflows keep repo-edit access. This prevents artifact-producing agents from accidentally overwriting source files when they meant to write `.tandem/runs/.../artifacts/...`.

The write policy now applies only to mutating tools. Read-only inspection tools such as `read`, `glob`, and `grep` are no longer interpreted as write targets, so source-inspection nodes can gather repository evidence instead of immediately blocking themselves under artifact mode. Tandem also blocks intermediate nodes from using automation-level output-target fallback publication unless the node is explicitly allowed to access those targets. This closes the failure mode where an early repository-scope artifact was copied into source files that were listed as final workflow output targets.

File-read/source-scan research nodes now add a second orchestration-layer guard. Tandem snapshots tracked source-like files before the node runs, restores them immediately if the session mutates any of them, and fails the node before output reconciliation. This specifically addresses the live failure mode where a read-only source-inspection node overwrote repository files with `PREWRITE_REQUIREMENTS_EXHAUSTED` repair JSON. Repair-exhausted status JSON is also treated as blocked runtime state instead of recoverable artifact content, so a failed repair loop cannot be promoted into a fake `.json` output.

Together, the write policy and source-scan snapshot guard mean artifact-producing nodes are blocked before writing outside their declared targets when possible, and source files are restored if a write slips through another path. The workflow should now fail loudly with an actionable node error instead of silently corrupting the repo or accepting a blocked repair payload as a valid artifact.

Run-start cleanup has also been narrowed. Tandem now clears only run-scoped node artifacts during Automation V2 startup, not automation-level publication targets. This closes the failure mode where a workflow that listed tracked source files as final output targets deleted those files before its source-inspection nodes could read them.

Artifact validation now rejects placeholder markdown such as "initial artifact created", "required workspace output path exists", and "will be updated in-place" as incomplete output. Connector preflight validation also requires declared concrete MCP tools to actually run; for example, a GitHub preflight that names `mcp.githubcopilot.get_me` and `mcp.githubcopilot.search_repositories` cannot pass by writing a JSON artifact that says those calls were not attempted.

Prompt execution now also prevents those preflight nodes from writing artifacts too early. When a request-scoped tool allowlist includes concrete MCP tools, workspace write tools stay hidden until those exact MCP tools have been attempted. This closes the newer loop where a GitHub connector check could call `mcp_list`, discover a cold/disconnected server, write a blocked status artifact, and then churn through repair attempts for minutes without ever attempting the required `get_me` or repository search calls.

Connector preflight has also been generalized beyond GitHub. Automation output enforcement can now declare `required_tool_calls` with tool names, optional arguments, evidence keys, and required-success flags. Connector-preflight nodes execute those calls through the normal tool registry and write structured diagnostics before falling back to the LLM loop. GitHub access checks are now just one instance of the same required-tool-call mechanism that can be used for Notion, Gmail, or any future MCP-backed connector.

Provider and tool failures during prompt execution now mark the session failed and clear cancellation state when they return early. This avoids stuck "in progress" sessions after provider stream connect, idle, chunk, or tool execution errors.

Bug Monitor also dedupes Automation V2 failure fanout more aggressively. Automation V2 context blackboard mirror failures now carry workflow/run metadata, and Bug Monitor candidate detection ignores those mirrored `context.task.failed`, `context.task.blocked`, and `context.run.failed` events so the primary `automation_v2.run.failed` incident remains the canonical report instead of generating one draft per downstream node.

Automation V2 repair loops now respect the node attempt budget instead of maintaining a separate validator-only repair counter. Artifact validation records the current node attempt and max attempts, computes repair exhaustion from that same budget, and blocks hard contract failures such as non-terminal artifacts, missing current-attempt outputs, missing concrete MCP calls, and read-only source mutations instead of allowing another repair cycle that reports `repair_attempt: 0`.

Stale-reaped runs now stay paused for operator inspection by default. The previous auto-resume path could relaunch a node immediately after the runtime detected that its provider/tool session had stopped producing evidence, which turned a clear stalled-node condition into another long-running loop. Operators can opt the old behavior back in with `TANDEM_ENABLE_STALE_AUTO_RESUME`, but the default is now fail-visible rather than self-spinning.

The Automation V2 executor also protects completed nodes from late stale outcomes. If a node is already completed or has a passing validated artifact, later success/failure results from duplicate or stale sessions are ignored instead of overwriting the settled state. Pending nodes that exhaust their attempt budget now report the actual exhausted node in the run failure, rather than collapsing into a generic flow-deadlock message.

Read-only source-scan nodes now receive a narrower tool surface. Broad source-inspection tasks drop source-mutating tools such as `apply_patch`, `edit`, and shell execution unless the node is an explicit code-edit workflow. This complements the write-policy and source-snapshot guards: source archaeology nodes should read and write declared artifacts, not reach for repo mutation tools.

### Engine build entrypoint restored

The `tandem-engine` binary entrypoint has been restored so `cargo build -p tandem-ai --profile fast-release` can compile the engine package again.

## v0.4.44 (Released 2026-04-27)

This release turns strict knowledgebase channels from a slow LLM-driven demo path into a fast, governed KB-answering path, and adds the memory import surface needed to seed larger project/session memories from server-side files.

### Strict KB channels answer quickly without leaving evidence mode

Strict KB channels now take a direct `answer_question` path when a knowledgebase MCP is selected and the user asks a text question. Instead of sending the request through the normal LLM tool loop and waiting for the model to repeatedly call KB tools, the server calls the KB MCP directly, persists the tool evidence into the session, and renders a strict answer from the returned evidence. This keeps Telegram and Discord KB bots responsive enough for hosted demos while preserving the same source receipts and channel history.

The strict renderer now treats `answer_question` payloads as first-class grounding evidence. If the MCP returns `suggested_answer` and `evidence[].content`, Tandem can render a concise answer immediately. If `TANDEM_STRICT_KB_GROUNDED_SYNTHESIS=1` is set on the engine process, Tandem may ask the model for an evidence-only JSON synthesis, then validates the result before returning it. Unsupported model output falls back to deterministic KB rendering; undefined policy, private-contact, and external-action cases remain deterministic and fail-closed.

The direct path also fixes a registry-name bug in full-document fetches. Model-facing MCP tool namespaces normalize names with underscores, for example `mcp.aca_kb_mcp_local.answer_question`, while Settings can store the real server name with hyphens, for example `aca-kb-mcp-local`. Strict grounding previously tried to call `get_document` on the normalized namespace and failed. It now resolves both underscore and hyphen variants so renaming an MCP in Settings does not silently break grounding.

Finally, strict KB rendering no longer lets malformed `suggested_answer` values spill raw document bodies into channel replies. Tandem preserves line boundaries while parsing evidence, strips nested `Suggested answer:` prefixes, and cuts off leaked `Source:`, markdown headings, and frontmatter before rendering. A query like “What should staff do if the stream ingest fails?” should now produce a compact answer and safe source label instead of dumping the top of the runbook.

### Memory imports are available through HTTP, SDKs, Files, and Memory

The engine now exposes `POST /memory/import` for importing server-side paths into Tandem memory. The first source kind is `path`; supported formats are `directory` and `openclaw`; supported tiers follow the memory system (`project`, `session`, and global-compatible tiers as supported by the importer). The route validates that path imports are non-empty, readable, and correctly scoped: project imports require `project_id`, and session imports require `session_id`.

The response returns import stats (`discovered_files`, `files_processed`, `indexed_files`, `skipped_files`, `deleted_files`, `chunks_created`, `errors`) and emits tenant lifecycle events for started, succeeded, and failed imports. TypeScript and Python clients now include helpers:

- `client.memory.importPath(...)`
- `client.memory.import_path(...)`

The control panel now treats memory import as both a Files workflow and a Memory workflow. Files has an `Import to Memory` action so operators can browse the workspace/managed file tree and import the selected folder, or the containing folder for selected files. Memory keeps an `Import Knowledge` shortcut with the same path-based dialog for runtime knowledge management. Both paths support format/tier selection, project/session fields, optional sync-delete, clear error handling, and a result summary card with import stats.

Files is also promoted into the primary navigation before Memory, because it is the natural source-selection surface. Memory remains the runtime management surface for search, inspection, manual memory creation, deletion, and audit-oriented metadata.

The Memory page now defaults to a governed Knowledge view instead of showing every runtime record as one flat feed. Conversation-derived records such as `user_message`, `assistant_final`, and channel message memories are still available under Runtime/All filters, but they no longer make the default knowledge surface look like a channel transcript.

### OpenAI Codex model discovery can refresh from the connected account backend

The `openai-codex` provider was using a baked model list in two different places: the runtime provider catalog in `tandem-providers` and the settings/provider HTTP catalog in `tandem-server`. That meant new Codex models could be missing from Settings even when the connected Codex account could use them.

The two static lists are now collapsed into one shared starter catalog, and that starter catalog includes `gpt-5.5`. More importantly, when a Codex auth token is available, the provider catalog now tries live discovery against the Codex account backend before falling back to the static list. Connected installs can therefore pick up backend-published Codex models without waiting for Tandem to ship another baked-list update, while disconnected installs still show the known starter models.

### npm upgrades now replace stale engine binaries

The `@frumu/tandem` npm postinstall script no longer skips native binary installation just because `bin/native/tandem-engine` already exists. That old existence check caused package/binary mismatches during global npm upgrades: for example, upgrading the npm package to `0.4.39` could leave a previous `0.4.19` `tandem-engine` binary in place, so every start continued to report an available update.

The installer now runs the existing binary with `--version`, compares it to the package version, and downloads/replaces the release asset when the binary is missing, too small, unreadable, or version-mismatched. Matching binaries still skip the download path.

## v0.4.43 (Released 2026-04-27)

This release improves hosted Tandem server usability by making the Files page manage workspace repos directly, and fixes two regressions: a Slack-only duplicate-reply loop after engine restarts, and a planner wrapper that refused structurally valid workflow plans whenever a model emitted an off-label `action` discriminant.

### Hosted Files page can manage workspace repos directly

Provisioned hosted installs now treat the container workspace as the primary Files destination. The control panel exposes a Workspace explorer rooted at `/workspace/repos`, resolved from `TANDEM_CONTROL_PANEL_WORKSPACE_ROOT`, and the hosted compose renderer mounts `HOSTED_REPOS_ROOT` there read-write for `tandem-control-panel`. The generated control-panel config also defaults `repository.worktree_root` to `/workspace/repos` while leaving `repository.path` empty until a specific repo is selected.

The new workspace file APIs list directories, read previews, download files, upload files or folders, create directories, and delete workspace entries. All workspace paths are resolved under the configured workspace root and reject traversal, null bytes, invalid relative paths, and absolute paths outside the root. The existing managed buckets (`uploads`, `artifacts`, `exports`) remain available as a secondary mode instead of being the hosted default.

The Files UI now includes a minimal explorer with breadcrumbs, root/up navigation, current-directory uploads, folder upload with browser relative paths preserved, create-folder controls, preview/download/delete actions, and a collapsible file panel. The KB upload surface now has a real collection dropdown for existing KB MCP collections plus a new-collection path, and document rows can be clicked again to close their preview. Files and KB tool controls now use registered Lucide icons instead of plain text-only buttons, and the per-page selectors were restyled so the numeric values no longer look clipped or misaligned in the dark control-panel chrome.

The Files page also degrades cleanly during mixed frontend/backend rollouts: it only opens Workspace by default when capabilities explicitly advertise the workspace file API, and it falls back to managed buckets if `/api/workspace/files/list` returns 404.

The Coding dashboard now has an explicit repository sync action for the selected ACA project. Operators can clone or fast-forward a managed checkout before launching a run, and ACA now initializes local non-git folders as local git repositories so local workboards/local files can still flow through the branch, commit, and review pipeline. Dirty git checkouts remain protected: ACA refuses to pull over uncommitted changes.

### Slack channel adapter no longer replays recent messages on engine restart

The Slack channel adapter polls `conversations.history` every three seconds and tracks a `last_ts` cursor so it only forwards messages it has not already processed. The cursor lived only in the listener task's stack frame and was initialised to an empty string at startup, which meant every engine restart hit Slack with no `oldest` filter and pulled back the most recent ten messages. Anything still in that window — most visibly a `@Tandem` mention sent earlier in the day — was reprocessed and answered again, so users on hosted instances saw the same Tandem reply land two or three times across the same Slack thread as the engine cycled.

Discord and Telegram never had this problem: Discord streams events from the gateway, and Telegram long-polls with `getUpdates` offsets the server treats as acks, so neither replays history when the adapter reconnects. Slack's polling adapter has no equivalent server-side ack, which is why the empty-string cursor was visible only on Slack.

The Slack listener now seeds `last_ts` to the listener's startup wallclock formatted as a Slack `seconds.microseconds` timestamp, before the first poll, so only messages posted after the engine starts are picked up. The trade-off is that messages sent during the brief restart window are dropped instead of replayed; for hosted operator chat surfaces that is strongly preferable to spamming the same answer multiple times. A future change can persist `last_ts` per channel under the engine state directory if zero-loss semantics across restarts become important.

### Wizard no longer falls back to a generic plan when the planner LLM hallucinates the wrapper action

The Simple Wizard, Mission Builder, and chat-native automation drafts all share `try_llm_build_workflow_plan` in `tandem-plan-compiler`. The planner LLM is told to return one of two top-level shapes — `{"action":"build", ..., "plan":{...}}` or `{"action":"clarify", ..., "clarifier":{...}}` — and the wrapper deserialised `action` straight into a strict two-variant enum.

After 0.4.41 the planner system prompt grew significantly: the approval-gate policy section, the phased-DAG decomposition guidance, and the teaching library now teach the planner step-level vocabulary like the `discover` / `synthesize` / `validate` / `deliver` phase ids and step ids such as `synthesize_analysis_outline`. Some planner models — most visibly `gpt-5.4-mini` selected via the wizard's planner model override — started writing those step-level labels into the wrapper `action` field, e.g. `{"action":"synthesize_analysis_outline", "plan":{...valid plan...}}`. `serde_json` rejected the wrapper with `unknown variant 'synthesize_analysis_outline', expected 'build' or 'clarify'`, the planner reported `invalid_json`, the wizard hid the structurally valid plan behind the "Planner returned a fallback draft" banner, and operators could not create new automations from the wizard at all.

The fix has two halves:

- The wrapper enum now has a `#[serde(other)]` `Unknown` variant so off-label discriminants no longer fail deserialisation. `PlannerBuildPayload::resolved_action` infers the canonical action from the payload shape: a `plan` field implies Build, a `clarifier` field implies Clarify, and the empty case falls through to Build so the existing empty-plan branch can produce a fallback draft with the assistant's text instead of erroring on the wrapper. The plan body still has to validate against the same `WorkflowPlan` schema as before, so this does not loosen any guardrail beyond the action-name string match.
- The planner prompt now states explicitly that `action` MUST be the literal string `build` or `clarify` and never a step id or phase name, and that step-level concepts (`discover`, `synthesize`, `validate`, `deliver`, etc.) belong inside `plan.steps`, never in the wrapper.

Three new `planner_build::tests` unit tests cover unknown-action-with-plan, unknown-action-with-clarifier, and canonical-action pass-through.

## v0.4.42 (Released 2026-04-26)

This release fixes three regressions that were keeping provisioned hosted servers from being usable end-to-end after the 0.4.41 release.

### Hosted Files page now populates the KB collections

The KB MCP container drops privileges from root to the `tandem` user before launching uvicorn so the long-running service is not root. The bundled secret `/run/secrets/kb_admin_api_key` is mode-`600` root-owned, which meant the dropped-privilege uvicorn could not even `stat` the file. Every `/admin/*` request crashed inside the auth dependency with `PermissionError`, which the control-panel proxy translated to `configured: false`, leaving the Files page empty on provisioned servers even though the same flow worked locally.

The KB launcher now reads the admin key into the `KB_ADMIN_API_KEY` env var while still root, and the settings loader guards the file existence check against `PermissionError` as defense-in-depth so the env-var fallback is actually reachable. With both fixes the Files page populates the KB collections the same way it does on local installs.

### Hosted task and board endpoints stop returning `name 'logger' is not defined`

Two ACA modules — `task_sources.py` and `worker.py` — referenced `logger.debug(...)` without ever importing or defining a logger. Every `GET /projects/{slug}/tasks` and `GET /projects/{slug}/board` raised `NameError`, which FastAPI surfaced as a 400 with `{"detail":"name 'logger' is not defined"}`. The control panel could never render project tasks or boards on hosted servers as a result. Both modules now define a module-level logger.

### Files navigation visible by default for hosted installs

`ACA_CORE_NAV_ROUTE_IDS` now includes `files`, so provisioned hosted servers — which always bundle the KB MCP — show the Files surface in the sidebar by default instead of hiding it under the Advanced / experimental sections operators had to toggle on manually before they could use the KB upload UI.

## v0.4.41 (Unreleased)

This unreleased build adds chat-native automation drafts for Discord, Telegram, Slack, and direct channel conversations, hardens workflow-planning handoff for explicit planner flows, and lays the foundation for **default approval gates and rich channel UX** (see `docs/internal/approval-gates-and-channel-ux/PLAN.md`).

### Approval-gate foundation

- **Unified approval data model**: New `tandem_types::approvals` module defines `ApprovalRequest`, `ApprovalDecision`, `ApprovalSourceKind`, `ApprovalTenantRef`, `ApprovalActorRef`, `ApprovalDecisionInput`, and `ApprovalListFilter`. Every Tandem subsystem (control panel, channel adapters, future surfaces) consumes one shape regardless of which subsystem owns the underlying pending state. The aggregator and decision routing remain authoritative through subsystem-specific handlers (e.g. `POST /automations/v2/runs/{run_id}/gate_decide`); a unified decide endpoint is intentionally deferred until at least two source subsystems are wired.
- **Cross-subsystem approvals aggregator**: New `GET /approvals/pending` endpoint returns a unified list of pending approval requests, drawn today from `automation_v2` mission runs whose `checkpoint.awaiting_gate` is set. Coder and workflow sources will plug in once their pause/resume paths are wired. Filterable by `org_id`, `workspace_id`, `source`, and `limit`. Tested against real state via three integration tests covering surface, empty, and source-filter behavior.
- **Why this matters**: control panel, Slack/Discord/Telegram channel adapters, and future approval surfaces will all read from the same endpoint. The shape is stable; surface implementations slot on top without re-shaping the data.

### Slack interactive approvals (W2 vertical slice)

- **Webhook signing module** at `tandem-channels/src/signing.rs` with three platform verifiers: Slack HMAC-SHA256 with 5-minute replay protection, Telegram per-webhook secret-token constant-time compare, and a Discord Ed25519 stub returning `SecretNotConfigured` until `ed25519-dalek` lands in W4. 22 unit tests cover valid signatures, missing/malformed headers, replay window violations, body tampering, secret mismatches, and edge cases.
- **`InteractiveCard` trait extension**: `Channel::send_card(InteractiveCard)` added to the channel trait as a _separate method_ (not an optional field on `SendMessage`) so the type system tells callers which adapters have wired rich rendering. Default impl returns `InteractiveCardError::NotImplemented`. The `InteractiveCard` shape (title, body markdown, fields, primary/secondary/destructive buttons, optional reason prompt, optional thread key, opaque correlation) is the single source of truth across Slack/Discord/Telegram.
- **Slack Block Kit renderer** at `tandem-channels/src/slack_blocks.rs`: pure functions converting `InteractiveCard` to Block Kit JSON, fully golden-testable without a Slack workspace. Layout: header → context → body section → fields grid → divider → actions block (chunked at Slack's 5-button cap). Helpers for the post-decision in-place edit (`chat.update`) and the rework reason modal (`views.open`). 18 tests assert exact JSON shapes including button styling, confirm dialogs, and correlation round-trips.
- **`POST /channels/slack/interactions` endpoint**: receives Slack button clicks. Verifies HMAC on every request via the new signing module; rejects forged or stale requests with `401 Unauthorized`. Acks within Slack's 3-second window. Bounded LRU dedup ring on `(action_ts, action_id)` absorbs Slack's retry-on-missed-ack. Parses the URL-encoded `payload` field, extracts the primary action, dispatches `approve` / `cancel` directly to `automations_v2_run_gate_decide`. Rework decisions parse correctly; the modal round-trip lands in W4. New `SlackConfigFile.signing_secret` field carries the app signing secret.
- **Race UX in gate-decide 409**: when two surfaces try to decide the same gate concurrently (Slack click + control-panel click), the loser's `409` response now includes `winningDecision { node_id, decision, reason, decided_at_ms }` plus `currentStatus`. Slack/Discord/Telegram deferred replies can render "already decided by @alice" instead of a raw error.
- **Why this matters**: this is the discovery slice from `docs/internal/approval-gates-and-channel-ux/PLAN.md`. The risky parts (auth, idempotency, race UX, type-safe rendering) are now done and tested. The remaining Slack work (in-place edit dispatch, threaded run-status replies, App Home pinned approvals) needs a real Slack workspace to verify end-to-end and is staged for a follow-up real-Slack session. Discord and Telegram adapters in W4 inherit the same signing, trait shape, and interaction patterns.

### Default-on approval gates and Approvals Inbox (W3)

The agent-owned-workflows pitch becomes runnable end-to-end on `automation_v2` missions. Generate intent → compiler auto-wraps high-stakes steps → run pauses on the gate → operator sees and decides in a single inbox.

- **Tool approval classifier** at `tandem-tools/src/approval_classifier.rs`: pure, table-driven, exhaustively unit-tested (19 tests). Maps every Tandem built-in plus the curated MCP catalog (CRM, payments, outbound communications, public posts, calendar, trackers, Notion, GitHub mutating verbs, coder merge/publish) to one of `RequiresApproval | NoApproval | UserConfigurable`. Suffix heuristics (`.send`, `.publish`, `.create`, `.update`, `.delete`, `.merge`, `.pay`, `.charge`, `.refund`) catch unknown vendors. Default-deny for ambiguous cases.
- **Default-on compiler gate injection** at `tandem-plan-compiler/src/mission_runtime.rs`: walks every projected workstream node, classifies its tool allowlist, and attaches a default `HumanApprovalGate` when the node touches an external mutation. Idempotent (preserves explicit blueprint gates), scope-override-aware (honors a future `metadata.approval.skip_approval` from the ScopeInspector toggle), and skips Approval/Review stages whose gates are blueprint-owned. 7 golden tests cover CRM-write injection, outbound-email injection, pure-read no-injection, wildcard injection, unknown-tool fail-closed, scope override skip, and explicit-blueprint-gate preservation.
- **Planner-prompt teaching**: the planner agent is now told the runtime owns gate placement. New "Approval gates:" section in `workflow_plan_common_sections()` says: don't add gates yourself; describe the workflow as if approvals are present; batch related external actions to minimize approval count; declare `stage_kind=Approval` only when the gate IS the point of the step. The compiler enforces what the prompt promises.
- **Approvals Inbox** at `#/approvals` in the control panel. Polls `GET /approvals/pending` every 5s, renders each pending request as a card (workflow name, source, action preview, identifiers, requested-at), with Approve / Rework / Cancel buttons in colors that match each decision's stake. Rework opens an inline reason form. Race-aware: a 409 from gate-decide (W2.6) surfaces as "already decided by another operator" instead of a raw error. Wired into navigation as a top-level route with the shield-check icon.
- **Deferred to a focused TS session**: the per-step override toggle inside `ScopeInspector.tsx` (a 2884-line file). The compiler-side hook (`metadata.approval.skip_approval`) is already wired and tested, so the toggle plugs in without further server work and does not block W4 (Discord + Telegram) or W5 (notification fan-out + slash commands).
- **Net for the demo plan**: every gap that the demo's Tier 0 acceptance test depends on now has shipping code: gates are wired into the demo workflow's compile path, approvals surface as both a control-panel inbox and (via W2's Slack interactions) a chat-native flow, and the run-time governance promise is verifiable on synthetic-data runs.

### Discord and Telegram interactive approvals (W4)

Brings Discord and Telegram up to parity with W2's Slack interactive cards. Operators can now approve, reject, or rework a workflow gate from any of the three channels — or the control-panel inbox — and the runtime sees one decision regardless of surface.

- **Discord Ed25519 signature verification** is now real (the W2 stub is replaced). The `verify_discord_signature` function in `tandem-channels/src/signing.rs` decodes the application public key, reconstructs the signed payload as `{timestamp}{body}`, and verifies via `ed25519-dalek`. Discord disables endpoints that fail validation even once, so this is mandatory plumbing — 9 new tests cover valid signatures, missing/malformed headers, wrong-key forgery, wrong-body forgery, wrong-timestamp forgery, and invalid public-key hex.
- **Discord rich-UX renderer** at `tandem-channels/src/discord_blocks.rs`: pure functions converting `InteractiveCard` to one embed plus chunked action-row JSON, the post-decision in-place edit (with color transitions: amber pending → emerald approved → indigo reworked → red cancelled), modal data for the rework reason flow, and deferred/inline interaction response wrappers. `parse_custom_id` round-trips the `tdm:{action}:{run_id}:{node_id}` correlation. `allowed_mentions: parse=[]` so approval cards never @-ping. 19 golden tests assert exact JSON shapes and button-style mappings.
- **`POST /channels/discord/interactions` endpoint** receives every Discord interaction (PING, button click, modal submit, slash command). Verifies Ed25519 on every request, ack-PINGs, dispatches button clicks to the existing gate-decide handler, and opens a modal on Rework. Bounded LRU dedup on `interaction_id` absorbs Discord retries. Race UX maps non-200 gate-decide failures to a UPDATE_MESSAGE so Discord stays happy and the user sees the conflict. New `DiscordConfigFile.public_key` field.
- **Telegram inline-keyboard renderer** at `tandem-channels/src/telegram_keyboards.rs`: pure functions converting `InteractiveCard` to MarkdownV2 text + inline keyboard JSON, the post-decision `editMessageText`/`editMessageReplyMarkup` payloads, and `force_reply` (Telegram's modal substitute) for the rework reason flow. Emoji prefixes (`✓`/`✗`/none) signal button intent since Telegram has no button-style enum. `build_callback_data` respects Telegram's 64-byte cap with a truncation marker that the dispatcher resolves via cache (W5 wiring). Full MarkdownV2 escaping. 16 golden tests cover keyboard layout, callback_data round-trip, truncation, MarkdownV2 escaping, force-reply payload, and label truncation.
- **`POST /channels/telegram/interactions` endpoint** receives Telegram callback_query updates. Verifies `x-telegram-bot-api-secret-token` on every request via the W2 signing module. Bounded dedup on `update_id`. Dispatches button clicks to the existing gate-decide handler. Truncated callback_data fails closed pending the W5 short-lived cache. New `TelegramConfigFile.webhook_secret_token` field.
- **What's deferred to W5** (the supporting pieces that need real workspaces or shared dispatcher state):
  - The `chat.update`/`PATCH /channels/.../messages/{id}`/`editMessageText` _dispatch_ against real workspaces (the builders are tested; calling the API end-to-end requires plumbing the original message ID from post-send response back through gate-decide).
  - Telegram force-reply _capture_ (the payload builder is shipped; the dispatcher state machine that intercepts the user's NEXT message and routes it as the rework reason shares plumbing with `channel_automation_drafts`).
  - Truncated-callback-data resolution via short-lived cache.
  - Threading per workflow run (Discord threads, Telegram supergroup topics).
- **Net**: 47 new tests across W4. All four surfaces (control panel + Slack + Discord + Telegram) accept signed interactions, deduplicate retries, and dispatch through the same authoritative `automations_v2_run_gate_decide` handler. The runtime sees one decision per gate regardless of surface.

### Notification fan-out, slash commands, authority resolver (W5)

The runtime side of the agent-owned-workflows pitch is now production-shaped: notifications never get lost, channel users have grown-up commands for managing pending approvals, and every channel-side decision resolves to a stable engine principal for audit.

- **Approval notification fan-out task** at `tandem-server/src/app/approval_outbound.rs` is a polling outbox. The Plan agent flagged the engine event-bus pattern as wrong for approvals — `tokio::sync::broadcast::error::RecvError::Lagged(_)` drops events and a missed approval means a stuck run. The fan-out instead polls `/approvals/pending` (an idempotent read of durable state) on a configurable interval (default 5s) and dispatches new requests through a `Vec<Arc<dyn ApprovalNotifier>>`. In-memory `DedupRing` (FIFO at 8192) prevents re-dispatch; `prune_to` evicts decided requests. `NotifierError::Transient`/`Permanent` semantics let surface implementations decide their own retry/suppression strategy without blocking the polling loop. `run_polling_loop` exposes a cooperative `Arc<AtomicBool>` cancel for deterministic shutdown. 9 unit tests cover the full state machine.
- **Slash commands `/pending` and `/rework`** in the channel dispatcher. `/pending` lists outstanding workflow approval gates as a numbered chat-friendly summary (workflow name, run_id, action_kind). `/rework <run_id> <feedback>` sends a paused gate back for rework with the user's feedback, surfacing the W2.6 race conflict body as "already decided by another operator" instead of a raw error. Both registered in `BUILTIN_CHANNEL_COMMANDS` so registry-driven `/help` shows them in operator/trusted-team channels and excludes them from PublicDemo. 5 unit tests on parsing, missing-feedback rejection, registry presence, and PublicDemo disable.
- **Channel authority chain resolver** at `tandem-server/src/app/state/principals/channel_identity.rs`. `resolve_channel_user(config, kind, user_id)` returns `Resolved(RequestPrincipal)` / `ChannelNotConfigured(kind)` / `Denied { kind, user_id }`. The principal carries `actor_id = "channel:{kind}:{user_id}"` so distinct channel surfaces never alias the same user ID into the same actor — Slack's `U12345` and Discord's `U12345` resolve to different principals. Empty `allowed_users` is **deny-all** by design (channels must opt users in explicitly). Callers must treat denials as hard rejects — never silently approve as anonymous, because the audit trail would then carry no actor for an external mutation. 12 unit tests cover wildcard, deny-by-default, case insensitivity, Telegram `@`-prefix matching, missing config/user, and per-kind actor-id distinguishing.
- **Concurrent-race regression test** in `http/tests/approvals_aggregator.rs`. Fires two parallel `POST /automations/v2/runs/{run_id}/gate` requests against the same pending gate via `tokio::spawn`. Asserts exactly one 200 + one 409 with `winningDecision` populated, and that `gate_history.len() == 1` post-race. Mandatory before any rollout per the W5 plan — the previous W2.6 test simulated post-race state but did not exercise the per-run mutation lock under real contention.
- **What's deferred to a real-workspace session** (the supporting pieces that need live Slack/Discord/Telegram to verify):
  - Actual API-call dispatch for the W2/W4 in-place edits (`chat.update`, Discord PATCH, `editMessageText`) and threading.
  - Telegram force-reply _capture_ state machine (the payload builder is in W4; the dispatcher state-machine that intercepts the user's NEXT message shares plumbing with `channel_automation_drafts`).
  - Truncated callback-data resolution via short-lived cache.
  - Slack App Home pinned approvals (needs OAuth flow setup).
  - Workflow execution pause/resume (W1.4) — still wants the design conversation about routing workflows through the `automation_v2` executor vs parallel pause/resume in the workflow layer.
  - ScopeInspector per-step override toggle (W3.3) — focused TS task; the server-side hook (`metadata.approval.skip_approval`) is wired and tested.
- **Net**: every claim about the agent-owned-workflows pitch ("agents own workflows; humans approve boundaries; runtime governs") is now backed by tested code. Across W1–W5: **158 new tests** across 7 crates and 2 control-panel surfaces. The remaining work is platform integration, not new architecture.

### Chat-native automation drafts

- **Same-channel draft flow**: Automation creation requests now create bounded channel drafts that ask one follow-up question at a time in the same chat context instead of forcing users into the experimental workflow planner.
- **Durable draft API**: New channel-draft endpoints start or continue drafts, accept answers, return previews, confirm creation, cancel abandoned drafts, and expose pending drafts for diagnostics.
- **Consistent reply capture**: When Tandem asks a draft question, the next eligible non-command message from the same sender in the same room, thread, DM, or session answers that draft; other users and other scopes are ignored.
- **Explicit confirmation before activation**: Completed drafts return a plain-text preview and only create an active automation after the user replies with confirmation.
- **Channel-bounded automation metadata**: Confirmed automations carry source platform, channel, sender, scope, output target, and channel-derived tool/security bounds so chat-created automations stay within the channel's configured permissions.
- **Control-panel guidance**: Channel settings now describe next-reply capture, cancellation, confirmation, same-channel output defaults, and pending draft behavior without requiring a separate workflow-editor handoff.

### Engine authentication

- **Token auth by default**: `tandem-engine serve` now loads an explicit token, reads `TANDEM_API_TOKEN_FILE`, or creates a shared engine API token automatically when no token exists.
- **Shared local credential**: Desktop, TUI, control-panel, and direct CLI flows can rely on the same keychain-first/file-fallback credential instead of leaving direct engine starts tokenless.
- **Unsafe local opt-out**: Advanced trusted-local testing can still disable token auth with `--unsafe-no-api-token` or `TANDEM_UNSAFE_NO_API_TOKEN=1`; this mode is not intended for `0.0.0.0`, reverse-proxied, hosted, tunneled, or shared deployments.

### Workflow planning visibility

- **Explicit planning mode**: Planner sessions now persist `workflow_planning` state plus draft ID, source channel/platform, requesting actor, allowed and blocked tools, known and missing requirements, and validation state.
- **Clarification-first drafting**: Missing workflow details now trigger focused follow-up questions about triggers, inputs, outputs, publish behavior, required tools, approval, and memory/files instead of a fake-ready draft.
- **Connector-heavy workflow prompts**: Scheduled workflow prompts that mention MCPs or destinations such as Notion now route to workflow planning instead of being mistaken for integration setup.
- **No planner thread hijacking**: Linked workflow planner sessions no longer capture ordinary informational chat like "what is ..." or "what do I do?", and planner-model setup pauses now explain the admin action instead of asking for an impossible answer.
- **Structured audit trail**: Workflow planning now emits events for start, draft create/update, missing requirements, blocked capabilities, approval requests, validation, docs-MCP usage, and review readiness.

### Governance and handoff

- **Explicit blocked capabilities**: Required tools or MCPs that are not allowed stay blocked, are surfaced in the draft, and route through the existing approval queue instead of being silently widened.
- **Ordinary automation creation stays chat-native**: `automation_create` intents now use the channel draft flow, while workflow planner handling stays behind the existing experimental gate for explicit planner requests.
- **Workflow planner replies stay in chat**: Channel workflow-planning responses now surface planner questions, draft summaries, validation state, and blocked capabilities in the chat thread, with the control-panel link kept for review/apply.
- **Draft-first external channels**: Telegram, Discord, and Slack still return a compact preview plus the control-panel review link, and they do not directly activate workflows in V1.1.
- **Control-panel review details**: The planner review surface now shows the original request, source platform/channel, actor, draft status, validation status, required capabilities, blocked capabilities, approval requirements, and the generated preview.

### Demo readiness

- **Internal runbook**: Added `docs/internal/CHAT_WORKFLOW_PLANNER_DEMO.md` with setup, happy-path, missing-details, blocked-capability, and troubleshooting steps.
- **KB-first channel grounding**: Hosted and external knowledgebase MCPs can now be marked as grounding-required, and channel sessions that enable those KB MCP tools must inspect KB evidence before returning factual answers instead of relying on model memory.
- **Strict KB answer mode for channel bots**: Channels can now enable `strict_kb_grounding`, which rewrites the final reply from retrieved KB excerpts only, fails closed with `I do not see that in the connected knowledgebase.` when the KB has no supported answer, and adds short source footers when KB search results expose document paths.
- **Full-document strict KB evidence**: Strict KB mode now follows search hits with full `get_document` retrieval when KB source identifiers are available, so answers are based on complete source documents instead of truncated search snippets.
- **Safe source receipts**: Channel replies now show display-safe source labels such as `Company Overview`, `Sponsor FAQ`, `Staff Roles And Contacts`, and `Discord Community Rules` instead of local filesystem paths, storage keys, or internal document IDs.
- **Fail-closed snippet handling**: If a likely KB document is found but full content cannot be fetched, strict mode now refuses to answer from partial snippets rather than filling gaps with general model knowledge.
- **Policy-only external action answers**: Strict KB mode now answers external action requests from policy evidence only, so Discord moderation questions cannot fall back to generic UI/admin instructions unless those steps are actually in the KB.
- **Provider stream error repair**: Strict KB turns now repair provider stream decode failures after KB evidence retrieval, retry final synthesis once without streaming, and otherwise return a channel-safe retry message instead of raw `ENGINE_ERROR` details.
- **Evidence-only final answers**: Strict KB channel replies now render final answers from retrieved evidence sentences instead of model-authored helpful prose, preventing invented payout processes, staff-directory advice, escalation channels, and external-platform how-to steps from appearing in the demo bot.
- **Wildcard channel grounding**: Strict KB channels with default wildcard tool access now still bind enabled knowledgebase MCPs into the required KB search policy, preventing Telegram/Discord channel bots from bypassing grounding when operators have not explicitly listed each KB MCP tool.
- **MCP-context KB routing**: Channel messages with an explicitly selected MCP context now treat factual questions as strict KB turns even when the global channel strict-KB toggle is off, so Telegram DM knowledge bots do not silently fall back to generic model chat.
- **KB admin fail-closed check**: The control panel now treats the KB upload/browse surface as available only after `/api/knowledgebase/config` verifies that the KB admin backend is reachable, preventing `/collections` and `/documents` 502s from firing when the admin service is down or misconfigured.
- **Nested KB document deletes**: The control-panel KB proxy now forwards nested document slugs with a single encoded slash, so admin deletes work for documents stored below folders such as `automation/...`.

## v0.4.40 (Released 2026-04-24)

This release adds channel-aware workflow planning, so chat-driven workflow requests can now open a governed planner session, persist review state, and hand off into the control panel for validation and approval instead of only seeding automation setup.

### Channel workflow planning

- **Chat-to-planner handoff**: Workflow-intent messages now create or resume a planner session tied to the originating channel session, then open the workflow planner with the current draft.
- **Intent detection favors planning**: `/api/engine/setup/understand` now recognizes workflow-planning requests directly, so prompts like "draft a workflow plan" route into planner mode instead of generic integration setup.
- **Planner review state persists**: Planner sessions and drafts now record source platform/channel, linked session IDs, docs-MCP usage, required and blocked capabilities, validation status, approval status, and preview payloads so review survives reloads and follow-up messages.
- **Control-panel review banner**: Channel-seeded planner sessions now reopen in the planner UI with a handoff banner that shows the source channel, capability requirements, and approval state.

### Channel governance and safety

- **Workflow-planner gate**: A new server-owned `tandem.workflow_planner` pseudo-tool controls whether a channel can produce workflow drafts, and public-demo channels sanitize it out of saved tool preferences.
- **Capability approval flow**: Planner-detected capability gaps now route through the existing `mcp_request_capability` approval path instead of being dropped.
- **External-channel guardrails**: Telegram, Discord, and Slack responses stay summary-only and point operators to the control panel for review instead of activating workflows directly.

## v0.4.39 (Released 2026-04-23)

This release makes governed workflow repair durable. Strict-quality automation nodes now pass their repair policy into the engine, fail closed when required evidence never materializes, and stop downstream workflow branches from advancing on placeholder artifacts.

### Governed workflow repair

- **Request-scoped repair policy**: Engine prewrite requirements now carry node-derived `repair_budget` and repair-exhaustion behavior so governed runs can enforce fail-closed repair semantics without depending only on a global strict-mode environment variable.
- **Fail-closed strict-quality nodes**: Nodes resolved as `strict_research_v1` now block with a structured `repair_budget_exhausted` outcome when retries are consumed, instead of waiving unmet evidence requirements and proceeding to a best-effort write.
- **Budget propagation from workflow enforcement**: The automation server now forwards node repair budgets and exhaustion behavior from existing `output_contract.enforcement` settings into the engine request, keeping workflow authoring on the same governance surface.
- **Better repair-tool targeting**: When a repair is specifically missing concrete reads and workspace inspection is already satisfied, the engine now favors `read` over repeated `glob` exploration, making governed recovery attempts more purposeful.
- **Validator and orchestration alignment**: Server-side repair inference now uses the same repair budget semantics as the engine, so strict governed nodes stay blocked after exhausted evidence-gathering instead of being treated as soft `needs_repair` completions.

### Built-in Tandem Docs MCP

- **Preinstalled across control panels**: Tandem now bootstraps the official `tandem-mcp` server at `https://tandem.ac/mcp` during engine startup, so connected control panels immediately see the Tandem Docs MCP without requiring an operator to add it first.
- **Same granular controls as other MCP servers**: Because the docs server is registered through the normal MCP registry path, it still shows up in Settings with the usual connected/enabled state, per-tool allowlist controls, and standard connect/refresh/disable behavior.
- **Catalog visibility for recovery**: Tandem Docs MCP now also has a curated catalog entry, making it discoverable through the MCP browser and easier to restore if an operator removes it intentionally.

### Hosted Codex OAuth import

- **Codex `auth.json` schema drift tolerance**: Hosted control-panel imports now accept Codex CLI auth files whose `last_refresh` metadata is stored as a string timestamp instead of a numeric value.
- **No more immediate readback failure after upload**: Tandem now ignores that metadata shape difference when reconstructing the uploaded OAuth credential, fixing the hosted-server error that reported “The imported Codex auth.json could not be read back on this machine.”

## v0.4.38 (Released 2026-04-22)

This release moves recursive-authoring and governance policy behind a dedicated BUSL crate while keeping Tandem's public governance and agent surfaces stable across premium and OSS builds, and it also makes the automation planner much clearer when a long connector-backed plan is still working, needs clarification, or has fallen back after a failed planning run.

### Premium governance split

- **Dedicated BUSL governance engine**: Recursive-authoring and governance decisions now run through the new `tandem-governance-engine` BUSL crate instead of staying embedded inside the open server crate.
- **Stable public surfaces across editions**: The open runtime preserves the same route names, SDK methods, and agent tool names, and OSS builds now return explicit premium-feature errors when managed governance is unavailable.
- **Stable LLM docs across editions**: The Self-Operator and governance docs keep the same operational ordering and canonical names, but now call out edition availability and OSS fallback behavior explicitly.
- **Lifecycle review logic moved behind premium governance**: Health-check drift detection, expiration review state, retirement shaping, and dependency-revocation policy now evaluate inside the premium governance engine, while the open server remains the transport/persistence layer and treats the internal governance health checker as a no-op in OSS builds.

### Workflow planner reliability

- **Long-plan latency warning in the wizard**: The automation create flow now warns when a connector-heavy or unusually detailed prompt is likely to take a few minutes to plan, which is especially helpful for Reddit/Notion-style workflows that load multiple MCP-backed expectations into the planner.
- **Longer planner time budgets**: Workflow-plan preview requests now get more time on both the control-panel client and the server, reducing avoidable timeout failures on large or connector-heavy planning prompts.
- **Clarification budget now matches build budget**: Planner clarification and revision turns now inherit the same longer timeout budget as the initial build, so the follow-up answer path no longer falls off a shorter 120-second cliff.
- **Less duplicated planner payload**: The control panel now compacts the default knowledge subject sent with workflow-planner requests instead of embedding the full workflow prompt twice, which trims redundant prompt weight for large automations.
- **Clarification shown as a blocked state**: If the planner needs more information before it can produce a real workflow, the review step now shows that clarification directly instead of presenting the generic fallback scaffold as though it were the actual plan.
- **Fallback drafts hidden from creation**: When the planner falls back after a failed run, the review step now hides the scaffolded placeholder workflow and disables the create action so operators do not accidentally save a generic automation.
- **Clearer timeout errors**: `524` workflow-planner responses now surface as explicit engine-timeout errors, making it much easier to distinguish a slow planning run from an auth error or a bad request.
- **Planner stream decode fallback**: If the planner's streamed provider response dies with `error decoding response body` or a similar early stream corruption, Tandem now retries once with a non-streamed provider completion instead of abandoning workflow generation immediately.
- **Codex-specific streamed fallback**: When OpenAI Codex rejects a non-streamed `/responses` retry and requires `stream=true`, Tandem now performs a streamed completion recovery instead of surfacing that `400` as a planner failure.
- **Async planner session polling**: Workflow planner chat now runs through background planner-session operations and short polling requests, so the browser no longer depends on one long-lived planner HTTP call that a hosted proxy can kill before the engine finishes.

### MCP setup continuity in the automation wizard

- **Draft-safe MCP round-trips**: Leaving the automation wizard for MCP setup now preserves the current workflow draft in session storage and restores it when the operator returns.
- **Inline connect and sign-in actions**: Disconnected MCP servers can now be connected directly from the wizard, including follow-up OAuth completion flows for connectors such as Notion.
- **Return path from MCP settings**: The dedicated MCP page now shows when an automation draft is waiting and provides a direct route back to Automations after connector setup.

### Control panel polish

- **Refresh-safe remembered auth**: A hard refresh after rebuilding the control panel no longer emits a noisy `/api/auth/me 401` before the remembered token restores the session.
- **Wizard step scroll reset**: Moving between automation wizard steps now scrolls the active panel back to the top, so each new step opens at its actual starting position instead of leaving the operator halfway down the previous screen.
- **Automation browser requests stay human-owned**: The control-panel engine proxy now stamps forwarded automation requests with `x-tandem-request-source: control_panel` and strips browser agent lineage headers, while engine governance honors that source so normal create and run-now actions no longer trip `AUTOMATION_V2_AGENT_ID_REQUIRED`.
- **AI Composer agent test mode**: The automation composer now includes a testing mode that sends explicit agent-authored metadata (`x-tandem-agent-test-mode`, `x-tandem-request-source: agent`, synthetic `x-tandem-agent-id`) for create/run-now calls, letting operators exercise agent governance and capability escalation checks without a separate external client.

### Agent documentation and governance transparency

- **Agent-classification documentation updates**: Added clear guidance on control-panel vs agent request-source behavior and the headers that switch governance checks, including failure-code expectations (`AUTOMATION_V2_AGENT_*`, `AUTOMATION_V2_CAPABILITY_ESCALATION_*`).

## v0.4.37 (Released 2026-04-22)

This release adds the first governance layer for Self-Operator, with provenance, quotas, lineage limits, and approval surfaces enforced server-side, while also tightening the control panel experience around KB document browsing, exact channel MCP scopes, and app-native dialogs.

### Self-Operator governance foundation

- **Provenance-based automation ownership**: Automation v2 now records creator identity, chain of custody, and soft-delete retention, and the engine enforces ownership-aware create, patch, delete, run-now, pause, and resume paths.
- **Human approval surfaces**: The engine now exposes approval inbox routes plus grant/revoke and restore surfaces for governed automation changes.
- **Creation controls**: Tenant-level creation toggles, per-agent daily quotas, active caps, and per-agent creation pauses are enforced server-side.
- **Recursion gate**: Agent-authored automation creation and patching now require approval before escalating declared capabilities such as `creates_agents`, and server-side lineage depth checks block runaway custody chains.
- **Spend accounting and caps**: Automation v2 usage now rolls up per-agent daily, weekly, monthly, and lifetime spend summaries, warns at a configurable threshold, and hard-stops agents at the weekly spend cap with a quota-override approval request.
- **Lifecycle review and retirement**: Agent-authored automations now enter review after configurable creation or run thresholds, expire on schedule, surface health-check drift findings, and support retire/extend routes through the same operator review flow.
- **Dependency-revocation guardrail**: Removing a modify grant or narrowing MCP access now pauses the affected automation, creates a dependency-revoked lifecycle review, and keeps the automation blocked from agent mutation until the review is acknowledged.
- **MCP discovery overlay**: The MCP catalog endpoint now reports connected, cataloged, disabled, and uncataloged server states, and agents can file capability-gap requests through `mcp_request_capability` into the same approval queue used for other governed actions.

### Control panel UX

- **Shared modal dialogs**: Files, Task Planning, and KB document actions now use Tandem-styled prompts and confirms instead of native browser popups.
- **Sidebar ordering**: `Settings` stays pinned at the bottom of the sidebar, and `Files` remains grouped with the core navigation.

### Knowledgebase viewer

- **Inline document browsing**: KB collections now behave like a browser with click-to-expand previews, edit-in-place, and delete actions for uploaded documents.
- **Icon-first document controls**: The KB viewer now uses compact icon buttons for preview refresh, copy, edit, collapse, and delete.

### Channel MCP scoping

- **Exact per-channel MCP tools**: Channel tool preferences now keep exact MCP tool allowlists alongside server-wide MCP enables, which is what public channel bots and other constrained sessions need.
- **No widening on merge or sanitize**: Channel MCP exact-tool selections now survive preference merge and security-profile sanitization without being promoted back to a broad server-wide scope.

## v0.4.36 (Released 2026-04-20)

This release adds fine-grained MCP access control, letting operators expose exact tools per server and per workflow instead of opening an entire MCP server to every session.

### Fine-grained MCP access control

- **Per-server MCP tool toggles**: Connected MCP servers now list their discovered tools directly in the MCP management UI, and each tool can be individually enabled or disabled without disconnecting the rest of the server.
- **Runtime-enforced MCP tool hiding**: Server-level MCP tool allowlists now flow through the runtime and registry, so hidden tools disappear from the exposed MCP toolset instead of remaining callable after a UI-only toggle.
- **Scoped `mcp_list` output**: `mcp_list` now respects exact MCP tool policies as well as server-wide `mcp.<server>.*` scopes, which means public or restricted sessions only see the MCP tools they are actually allowed to use.
- **Workflow-level MCP narrowing**: Automation workflow editing and Studio agent editing now let operators choose exact MCP tools on top of MCP server selection, which is useful for public Discord/Telegram knowledge bots, automation runs, and any other environment where a shared MCP should not expose every remote action.
- **No accidental widening from exact tool picks**: Exact MCP tool selections in automation policy no longer get silently promoted to full `mcp.<server>.*` exposure just because the server had to be connected for discovery.

## v0.4.35 (Released 2026-04-20)

This release smooths the first-run flow for Tandem-hosted managed servers, makes hosted-only settings visible without relying on a localhost engine URL, hardens hosted Codex sign-in and recovery, and improves OAuth-backed MCP setup for provisioned installs.

### Control panel onboarding

- **Providers-first setup gate**: The provider setup requirement now opens the Providers tab and expands the provider catalog immediately, so new hosted installs land where they can actually select and configure a provider.
- **Hosted settings access**: Web Search and Scheduler settings are now editable on Tandem-hosted managed servers, so Brave/Exa keys and scheduler defaults show up on provisioned deployments even when the engine URL is remote.

### Hosted Codex auth

- **Codex auth import**: Provisioned servers can now import a Codex `auth.json` from the Settings page, and Tandem stores it under the VM's persistent Codex home so the connected session survives restarts and updates.
- **Persistent hosted Codex home**: Hosted provisioning now seeds the Codex home on the mounted engine volume so imported Codex credentials land in the right place automatically.
- **Refresh-safe pending sign-in**: If an operator refreshes Settings during a hosted Codex browser sign-in, the control panel now restores the pending session and resumes checking status instead of losing the in-progress handoff.
- **Hosted callback regression coverage**: The server test suite now proves that hosted-managed Codex authorize flows build a public hosted callback URL rather than silently dropping back to the localhost-only Codex CLI redirect.
- **Provider source visibility**: The dashboard and shared provider status surface now expose when the default Codex provider is running from an imported `auth.json`, which makes hosted support and operator triage much clearer.

### MCP OAuth setup

- **OAuth-first MCP guidance**: OAuth-backed MCP servers such as Notion now present an explicit browser sign-in flow in Settings and the dedicated MCP page instead of reading like a token-only connector form.
- **Pending OAuth recovery**: Tandem now keeps OAuth-backed MCP servers in a visible pending state, shows the authorization link and completion action, and automatically rechecks pending sessions while the page is open so operators do not need to spam manual refresh.
- **Real MCP OAuth bootstrap**: Tandem now handles Notion-style MCP OAuth discovery from the remote server's `401` challenge, follows protected-resource and authorization-server metadata, performs dynamic client registration plus PKCE, accepts the hosted callback, stores the bearer token on the MCP server, and reconnects the server automatically after sign-in.
- **Browser-origin MCP callbacks**: MCP OAuth redirects now prefer the forwarded control-panel/browser origin, so local or LAN control-panel installs no longer send Notion back to `127.0.0.1:39731` and fail behind the raw engine API-token check.

## v0.4.33 (Released 2026-04-19)

This release fixes hosted control panels so provisioned servers correctly identify themselves as Tandem-managed installs and can connect Codex without manual config edits.

### Hosted Codex auth

- **Hosted install profile propagation fix**: The live control panel now returns hosted-managed metadata from `/api/install/profile` and `/api/capabilities`, so the Codex Account button is enabled automatically on provisioned hosted servers.
- **Hosted OAuth readiness**: Hosted servers now surface the hosted control-plane URL and managed-hosted flag consistently through the runtime config path, so Codex sign-in uses the hosted flow instead of falling back to the local-engine-only path.

## v0.4.32 (Released 2026-04-19)

This release makes Codex account sign-in work on Tandem-hosted provisioned servers, so hosted workflows can connect to a real LLM instead of falling back to the generic default provider. It also adds a managed file explorer for hosted uploads, artifacts, and exports.

### Hosted Codex auth

- **Hosted-safe Codex OAuth**: Tandem-hosted control panels can now connect Codex through the hosted OAuth flow on provisioned servers instead of being blocked behind the local-engine-only browser path.
- **Public callback for hosted servers**: Codex OAuth redirect handling now uses the hosted public callback route when Tandem is running in hosted-managed mode, so the authorization flow can complete on a remote VM.
- **Hosted settings gate**: The control panel settings page now enables Codex account connect/reconnect actions for hosted-managed servers and explains that hosted servers use the hosted OAuth path.
- **Hosted provider fallback fix**: Provisioned servers no longer get stuck on the generic fallback provider simply because the Codex connect button was disabled in hosted mode.

### Hosted file explorer

- **Managed three-pane explorer**: The Files route now opens a folder-aware explorer for uploads, artifacts, and exports instead of a flat file list.
- **Preview and download actions**: Text, markdown, JSON, YAML, images, and PDFs can preview inline, and everything else falls back to metadata plus download.
- **Chat and run handoff links**: Chat attachments and automation artifact panels can jump directly into the correct folder or file in Files.
- **Tree-aware file API**: `/api/files/list` now returns directory metadata plus `parent` links so the explorer can keep nested folder state stable.

## v0.4.31 (Released 2026-04-17)

This release focuses on workflow reliability and authoring clarity after the `v0.4.30` Codex launch, plus a major round of automation-v2 executor and state-persistence fixes that surfaced under real production load.

### Workflow authoring and reliability

- **Workflow planner timeout resilience**: Workflow and mission-plan generation now allow longer planner runs and surface planner failures in the UI instead of silently dropping the progress state.
- **Generalized workflow deliverable repair**: Workflow fallback steps now infer the correct output contract for markdown reports, plain-text outputs, JSON exports, and code/config artifacts, which fixes the "run-log garbage report" class of workflow failures.
- **Automatic repair for saved malformed workflows**: Existing saved automations now self-heal output contracts, upstream handoff refs, and related synthesis metadata on load/save instead of requiring manual edits to `automations_v2.json`.
- **Timestamped output-path normalization**: Workflow output targets and node output paths now normalize legacy placeholders such as `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS` into Tandem-native runtime tokens, and runtime validation resolves them consistently during execution.
- **Studio output-path previews and warnings**: Workflow Studio now shows draft, saved, and next-run output-path previews plus inline warnings for ambiguous placeholder syntax, making timestamped artifact authoring much more predictable.
- **Provider picker decluttering**: Non-settings provider/model selectors now show only configured or connected providers, and internal channel/MCP config providers are filtered out so the full catalog stays available in Settings without cluttering the rest of the app.

### Agent prompt corrections

- **Declared output artifacts in node prompts**: Automation prompts now include an explicit "Declared Output Artifacts (CREATE — do not READ)" section whenever a node declares output files (`metadata.artifacts`, `builder.output_files`, or `builder.must_write_files`). The section tells agents these paths are outputs to create, ENOENT on them is expected, and returning a "missing source file" blocker for them is not acceptable. This fixes a class of stalled runs where agents misread their own output filenames as prerequisite inputs.
- **Declared-output repair corrective**: When a prior attempt blocked claiming a declared output was a missing source file, the repair brief on the next attempt now includes a targeted corrective note naming the specific paths and directing the agent to `write`/`edit`/`apply_patch` instead of `read`-ing them.
- **Email-delivery gate false positives fixed**: The engine-loop gate that overwrites agent completion text with "I could not verify that an email was sent" no longer fires solely from substring-matching "send" + "email" in the rendered prompt. It now additionally requires that email-action tools were actually offered to the agent during at least one iteration. Blog, research, and other non-email nodes that happened to see gmail tool names in an MCP catalog listing will stop having their legitimate output clobbered.

### Token usage and cost visibility

- **Token usage capture on streaming chat completions**: OpenAI-compatible chat-completions streaming now requests `stream_options.include_usage`, restoring real per-call prompt/completion/total token counts (and downstream cost attribution) that were previously silently zero for streaming calls.
- **Dashboard token usage panel**: The control panel dashboard now shows token usage and estimated cost bucketed by day/week/month in addition to aggregate totals.
- **Run debugger token/cost display**: The run debugger now surfaces prompt, completion, total tokens, and estimated USD cost per run, so operators can see real spend without leaving the UI.

### Automation v2 executor and scheduler reliability

- **Executor startup race fixed**: The automation v2 executor now waits for the startup snapshot to report `Ready` before calling `recover_in_flight_runs`. Previously the executor task could panic on `AppState::deref` when the runtime `OnceLock` wasn't yet populated, leaving queued runs stranded with no polling for the lifetime of the engine.
- **Executor supervisor self-healing**: The executor main loop is now wrapped in `catch_unwind` and respawns on panic, so a single state panic can no longer permanently kill the polling task.
- **Concurrent-batch outcome loss fixed**: When one outcome in a `join_all` batch produced a terminal `Err`, the remaining sibling outcomes in the same batch were silently dropped. The loop now continues instead of breaking, preserving successful sibling outcomes.
- **Spurious run-level failure from batch-mates fixed**: A node that succeeded now rescues a run that was prematurely flipped to `Failed` by a batch-mate's terminal error — clears `last_failure` for that node, resets status to `Running`, and emits a `node_recovered` lifecycle event.
- **Approval rollback attempt budget reset**: When an approval rollback re-queues upstream nodes, their `node_attempts` counters now reset so they have a fresh attempt budget instead of hitting max attempts mid-flight and causing false-positive run failure.
- **Mid-execution failure false positive fixed**: `derive_terminal_run_state` no longer flags a pending node as failed purely because its attempt counter reached max — it now also requires a terminal outcome in `node_outputs`, so a node whose latest attempt is still in flight isn't falsely counted as exhausted.
- **`Pausing` zombie workspace lock fixed**: Automation v2 runs stuck in `Pausing` state across a restart are now settled to `Paused` at recovery time, releasing their workspace lock. Previously a stale `Pausing` run from days ago could perpetually re-acquire its lock on every startup and block every new run on the same workspace.

### Persistence and storage hygiene

- **Daily automation run archiver**: A background task now moves terminal (`completed`/`failed`/`blocked`/`cancelled`) automation runs older than `TANDEM_AUTOMATION_V2_RUNS_RETENTION_DAYS` (default **7 days**) out of the hot `automation_v2_runs.json` into an atomically-written `automation_v2_runs_archive.json` sidecar. Runs once at startup and every 24 hours. Directly addresses the write-amplification problem where the hot runs file had grown to 130MB+ and was rewritten on every run status change, causing in-memory state to lag on-disk state by minutes under load.

### New configuration

- `TANDEM_AUTOMATION_V2_RUNS_RETENTION_DAYS` (default `7`) — controls how many days of terminal automation run history stay in the hot runs file before being archived. Set to `0` to disable archiving.

## v0.4.30 (Released 2026-04-16)

This release adds the first real Tandem path for using a Codex account allocation instead of burning API-key credits on every heavy local run.

- **Codex account auth foundation**: Tandem now supports `openai-codex` as a first-class provider with engine-owned OAuth credential records instead of flattening everything into saved API keys.
- **Engine-owned local OAuth flow**: Added provider OAuth authorize, callback, status, disconnect, PKCE/state handling, credential persistence, and refresh-aware auth lifecycle for local Codex account sign-in.
- **Structured provider credentials**: Provider auth can now store typed API-key and OAuth records with expiry, account identity, and ownership metadata, which is the groundwork needed for account-connected auth to coexist cleanly with normal API keys.
- **Control panel `Connect Codex Account` flow**: The local control panel now exposes browser-based Codex account sign-in, pending-state polling, connected account identity, reconnect, and disconnect actions.
- **Tandem-branded OAuth completion page**: Successful Codex account sign-in now lands on a Tandem-styled completion page instead of a generic callback screen.
- **OAuth-aware provider readiness**: Provider status and onboarding now understand OAuth-backed account connections instead of assuming every remote provider is API-key-only.
- **Distinct `openai-codex` routing**: Codex account usage now routes through a separate provider/catalog entry with starter models so it can be managed independently from the normal OpenAI API-key path.
- **Safer auth failure behavior**: Expired or invalid Codex sessions now surface explicit `reauth_required` state rather than silently behaving like a healthy saved-key provider.
- **Codex backend request compatibility**: Tandem now speaks the Codex backend’s actual request contract, including the Codex-specific responses route, required `instructions`, `store: false`, and removal of unsupported public-API fields like `max_output_tokens`.
- **Codex tool schema hardening**: Codex-bound browser and MCP tool schemas are normalized to avoid root-level JSON Schema combinators that the Codex backend rejects.
- **Default-provider promotion after connect**: When a Codex account is connected, Tandem now correctly routes local runs through `openai-codex` instead of continuing to hit quota-limited OpenAI API-key paths.
- **Discord guild-channel recovery**: Discord channel handling is now fixed for guild traffic, including empty `guild_id` normalization, working channel replies outside DMs, and stable mention-only intake.
- **Mention-only docs-tool recovery**: Discord mention-only prompts that route into Tandem Docs now recover the `task` argument from the actual user message instead of surfacing raw MCP 400 errors.
- **Docs search query recovery**: Tandem now recovers a missing `query` for `search_docs` from the user’s actual prompt, preventing another class of empty-arg MCP failures during docs-assisted chats.
- **Cost-control path for local testing**: This release is the first real step toward moving test-heavy local runs off OpenRouter spend and onto a Codex subscription allocation when one is available.

## v0.4.29 (Released 2026-04-15)

This release trims the control panel down to the core path so new users can get started faster.

- **Control panel simplification**: Planner, Studio, Orchestrator, and other experimental surfaces are now hidden by default so new users land on the core experience first.
- **Automation cleanup**: The Automations view now focuses on Create, Calendar, Library, and Run History, with Calendar kept visible as the scheduling surface and the non-functional dry-run affordances removed from the automation views and mission builder.
- **Brand icon polish**: Tandem now uses a clean default icon asset in the shell and settings preview, so the logo no longer gets clipped by the rounded frame.
- **Workflow compiler hardening**: Fallback plans now stay concrete, preserve exact filenames, and keep explicit `websearch` / `webfetch` instructions visible in the step that uses them.
- **Generalized workflow step scaffolding**: Fallback plans now use descriptive domain-neutral step IDs such as `summarize_inputs`, `gather_supporting_sources`, `draft_deliverable`, and `finalize_outputs` instead of reusing narrow built-in labels from unrelated workflow types.
- **Read-only source protection**: Source-of-truth files are snapshotted and restored on failure, preventing workflows from deleting or repurposing files like `RESUME.md`.
- **Exact-source repair guidance**: Repair briefs and repair-guidance payloads now include the exact source files that were still missing required `read` coverage, making blocked research-style retries much more actionable.
- **Channel registry and diagnostics**: Built-in channel listeners are discovered through a registry, surfaced with runtime diagnostics, and validated so unknown channel names return `404` instead of behaving like hidden fallthrough cases.
- **Channel registry hardening**: The new registry-backed channel help/config surfaces now serialize config values consistently and correctly invoke per-channel security profile callbacks during listener startup.

## v0.4.28 (Released 2026-04-14)

- **Packaged desktop startup crash after engine-ready**: Installed Tauri builds no longer eagerly load the workflow calendar and diff viewer libraries during desktop startup, preventing the `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'cssRules')` frontend crash that blocked the PIN/login UI from appearing after the backend came up.
- **Desktop route-level code splitting**: The automation calendar and diff viewer now lazy-load only when those views are opened, keeping heavy CSS-in-JS and FullCalendar initialization out of the initial desktop boot path.

## v0.4.27 (Released 2026-04-14)

- **Packaged desktop startup diagnostics**: The Tauri desktop app now boots through a lightweight startup loader before importing the full React workspace, so installed builds surface chunk-load and top-level frontend boot failures instead of hanging on the splash after the engine is ready.
- **Desktop startup signal hardening**: Frontend startup visibility and failure reporting now use shared bootstrap signals, making installed-build render failures observable on the splash screen rather than silently stalling behind a successful backend launch.

## v0.4.26 (Released 2026-04-14)

- **Installed desktop startup recovery**: Tauri-packaged builds now dismiss the splash based on actual React DOM mount, not just frontend-ready events, so the app can no longer stay stuck on the "engine ready" splash after the backend has fully started.
- **Frontend boot failure visibility**: Desktop startup now surfaces JavaScript boot errors directly on the splash screen instead of hanging indefinitely behind a seemingly successful backend startup state.

## v0.4.25 (Released 2026-04-14)

- **LLM workspace search acceleration**: The built-in `grep` tool now uses the ripgrep library stack (`grep-searcher`, `grep-regex`, `grep-matcher`) for faster repository search while keeping the same tool name, schema, and output shape.
- **Parallel search streaming**: `grep` now streams partial match chunks through engine events while it searches, so the harness can show results sooner without changing the final tool output.

- **Desktop splash dismissal recovery**: The Windows startup splash now waits for both backend-ready and React-visible signals before dismissing, so a fully loaded engine can no longer leave the app stuck on the ready screen.
- **Crate publish preflight hardening**: Release publishing now validates local path-dependency order up front and includes `tandem-enterprise-contract` in the publish sequence, so missing publish-list entries fail before the release job starts pushing crates.

- **Automation engine stability overhaul** (Phases 5–8):
  - **Glob-loop circuit breaker**: Added `detect_glob_loop()` that fires a repair signal when `glob` is called ≥10 times without any `read`, or when total tool calls exceed 30 without any write. This prevents nodes from stalling indefinitely in discovery loops.
  - **Standup JSON extraction hardening**: Added `extract_recoverable_json_artifact_prefer_standup()` that prioritizes extracting JSON with `yesterday`/`today` keys from markdown fences, prose-prefixed text, or multi-object responses.
  - **Per-node tool-call budget**: Added `max_tool_calls: Option<u32>` field to `AutomationFlowNode` for future use.
  - **Persistent run status**: Added `persist_automation_v2_run_status_json()` that writes run status to `{workspace_root}/.tandem/runs/{run_id}/status.json` after every update, making debugging possible without server access.
  - **Auto-resume after stale reap**: Added `auto_resume_stale_reaped_runs()` that automatically re-queues paused stale runs with repairable nodes (up to 2 times per run), integrated into both single and multi scheduler loops.
  - **Reduced default node timeouts**: `StandupUpdate` nodes now default to 120s timeout (was 600s); `StructuredJson` nodes to 180s.
  - **Standup node max attempts**: StandupUpdate nodes now explicitly default to 3 attempts.
  - **Structured run diagnostics**: Added `tracing::info!` at the end of each automation run with run ID, final status, elapsed time, node counts, and resource usage.

## v0.4.24 (Unreleased)

- **Enterprise transition groundwork**: added the public `/enterprise/status` surface, tenant-aware runtime propagation, and durable protected audit outbox coverage for approvals, provider secrets, MCP updates, workflow runs, and coder transitions.

- **Marketplace browse split**: The control panel marketplace is now browse-only and links out to tandem.ac, while the internal docs now define the public marketplace/server ownership split and launch sequence.
- **Marketplace server contract**: Added internal planning docs for the tandem.ac marketplace server API, route ownership, catalog/search/detail behavior, and the control-panel handoff model.
- **Desktop unlock startup progress visibility**: The desktop splash now listens to explicit backend startup events from vault unlock, keystore initialization, and sidecar boot so it stays on a live progress state instead of falling back to an empty waiting window.

- **Definitive workflow stability overhaul**
  - Explicit `{"status":"completed"}` signals from nodes now take absolute priority over all heuristic content scans. Nodes that signal completion and have an artifact on disk are marked completed immediately, regardless of what the artifact text contains.
  - Nodes whose status JSON is absent or unparseable are still marked completed when the artifact exists on disk and was written in the current attempt window, preventing stalled runs after engine restarts.
  - False-positive `blocked` and `verify_failed` downgrades are suppressed for nodes that already carry an explicit completed status. Secondary concrete-read audits and file-evidence content scans no longer override a node's own completion signal.
  - Bootstrap file-requirement inference is now skipped for terminal synthesis nodes (`brief`, `report_markdown`, `text_summary`, `citations`) that have upstream dependencies. These nodes receive their evidence from upstream; they should not be asked to re-discover workspace files before running.
  - Internal `ctx:...` context-write IDs are now stripped from upstream inputs for all node types before prompts are assembled, preventing models from hallucinating those engine-internal identifiers as filesystem write targets.
  - Research nodes with a declared required artifact now receive an explicit `Next Step` hint instructing the model to call `websearch` before writing, reinforcing the evidence-before-artifact contract without triggering an additional repair cycle.
  - A node's own declared `output_targets` are no longer injected into its required-file list, preventing the engine from treating a file the node is supposed to create as a file it must already have before starting.

## v0.4.23 (Released 2026-04-11)

- **Vault unlock startup safety net**: The desktop unlock flow now keeps the splash visible until the React app reports it is actually ready, and startup crashes show a visible recovery screen instead of a blank window.
- **Vault unlock critical path fix**: Vault unlock now returns immediately after the master key is restored, while keystore initialization and sidecar startup continue in the background. This prevents the unlock screen from getting stuck waiting on startup work.
- **Workflow stale-run recovery and operator actions**
  - Automation node prompts now time out cleanly instead of hanging forever and pinning the workspace lock.
  - Stale-run detection now uses live session activity, API `lastActivityAtMs` reflects the same session-aware view, and stale pauses mark in-flight nodes as repairable instead of leaving them opaque.
  - Recovering a stale-paused run now clears stale pending outputs and attempts so retry/recover actually requeue work instead of immediately refailing.
  - The control panel no longer gets stuck hiding retry, continue, or resume actions behind stale pending run-action state.
- **MCP-backed citations grounding retry fix**
  - Citations nodes that explicitly prefer MCP servers, such as `tandem-mcp` grounding steps, now validate as artifact-only instead of local workspace research.
  - This removes false `local_research` / `no_concrete_reads` blocking on recovered retries when the node's actual responsibility is to write grounded MCP notes into the required run artifact.

## v0.4.22 (Unreleased)

- **Workflow import, Workflow Center, and agent teaching**
  - Durable workflow bundle import now persists a planner session with provenance, validation, and an embedded draft instead of staying preview-only.
  - Added a Workflow Center surface so imported and saved workflow sessions can be browsed, reopened, and handed back into the planner.
  - Updated the agent-facing guide path so `mcp_list` is the first discovery step and missing MCPs are surfaced honestly instead of being guessed.
  - Corrected workflow docs so import is described as durable session creation, not automation arming.
  - Improved stale-run recovery so stalled nodes are surfaced as repairable and recover clears stale pending outputs and attempts.

- **Per-attempt forensic evidence**: Every automation attempt now generates a durable JSON forensic record, capturing full context for debugging and audit.
- **Explicit node file contracts**: Workflow nodes can now declare explicit `input_files` and `output_files` at authoring time, overriding heuristic workspace inspection and providing clearer contract enforcement.
- **Stale run handling**: Stale automation runs are now paused instead of failed, using a new `last_activity_at_ms` timestamp for more accurate detection.
- **Capability resolution hardening**: The automation runtime now fails closed when required capabilities are missing after MCP sync, and clears stale tool failure labels on retry.
- **Provider transport failure classification**: Network and authentication issues during tool execution are now classified as `provider_transport_failure` instead of generic workflow errors.
- **MCP workflow scoping**: Automation runs now only surface `mcp_list` when MCP servers are explicitly selected, and the inventory snapshot is filtered to the allowed servers instead of leaking the full connector registry.
- **Inspect run UI crash**: Fixed a UI crash in the WorkflowRequiredActionsPanel when `blockedNodeIds` or `needsRepairNodeIds` were undefined.
- **Grey/dark screen after vault unlock on desktop**: The 1-9+ second blank window that appeared immediately after entering the PIN on Tauri-packaged installs is now fixed. The sidecar status check on the startup path no longer blocks on a GitHub API call; a fast local-only binary check lets the app proceed in ~100 ms, while update detection continues in the background.
- **Clean-run workflow survival**: Fresh-workspace automation runs no longer fail immediately when the first `glob` returns empty. Empty discovery now counts as productive workspace inspection, and write-required nodes get a retry for preparatory tool cycles instead of being killed before they can reach `read`, `websearch`, or `write`.
- **Structured completion signal hardening**: When a node explicitly returns `{"status":"completed"}` and the artifact exists, the engine now treats that as authoritative instead of overriding it with heuristic phrase scans like `blocked`, `tests failed`, or concrete-read audit fallbacks.
- **False-positive blocked/verify_failed cleanup**: Report and assessment artifacts can now describe blocked upstream conditions or failed prior tests without being reclassified as blocked/verify_failed or having their accepted output cleaned up when the node itself completed successfully.

- **Connected-agent handoff documentation and UI wiring**
  - Added `handoff_config`, `watch_conditions`, and `scope_policy` fields to the `WorkflowEditDraft` interface so the control panel can safely modify automations containing handoff artifacts without dropping those fields.
  - Added a dedicated `Connected-Agent Handoffs` guide covering inbox/approved directory layout, auto-approval toggles, watch conditions, and restricted-access scope policies.
  - Documented the new Handoffs tab in the Control Panel workflow edit dialog, bringing full visibility and management for artifact staging to the frontend.

- **Engine Security & Governance Hardening**
  - Resolved 13 audit findings (including 2 critical sandbox/governance bypasses) across the core engine loop.
  - Fixed an issue where `batch` tool sub-calls could operate outside workspace boundaries and bypass permission/policy evaluations by properly inheriting and forwarding execution context.
  - Removed blanket local filesystem exemptions for MCP tools; added `TANDEM_MCP_SANDBOX_EXEMPT_SERVERS` for remote-only exceptions.
  - Enforced a 10-minute TTL maximum on workspace sandbox overrides, expanded sensitive path blocklists, and implemented deny-wins plugin permission precedence.
  - Prevented silent waiver of prewrite gates via `TANDEM_PREWRITE_GATE_STRICT=true`.

- **Standup Reporting Pipeline Infrastructure**
  - Integrated `StandupUpdate` validator contracts, standup enforcement profiles, and strict filler rejection pipelines to guarantee high-quality non-meta-commentary reports.
  - Added delta-aware previous standup injection to prevent duplicate findings across daily reports by automatically retrieving prior reports up to 7 days back.
  - Formalized workspace-root output conventions so final standup deliverables are consistently placed in `outputs/` for immediate human discoverability.

- **Workflow self-healing and retry hardening**
  - Fixed assess/triage nodes so they explicitly request workspace tools and no longer stall with MCP-only offers when the objective requires `glob` and `read`.
  - Fixed retry classification so missing required outputs, raw `TOOL_MODE_REQUIRED_NOT_SATISFIED` / `WRITE_REQUIRED_NOT_SATISFIED` endings, generic artifact synthesis failures, missed verification runs, and offered-but-unused delivery tools all re-enter repair flow instead of blocking prematurely.
  - Fixed current-attempt artifact materialization checks so promoted run-scoped outputs count as freshly materialized during the active attempt.
  - Fixed workflow bootstrap guidance so file-like targets such as `.jsonl`, `.json`, and `.md` are treated as files rather than directories.
  - Fixed runtime ledger `.json` rewrites being misclassified as unsafe protected-source rewrites, while preserving safety checks for real source/config files.
  - Added focused regression coverage around repair classification, required-output retries, ledger rewrites, prompt guidance, and delivery/verification retry behavior.

- **Workflow authoring and operator notes**
  - Strengthened artifact-writing prompts so retries explicitly rewrite the declared output, include a full `write.content` body, and avoid placeholder/path-only writes.
  - Kept filename expansion prompt-driven instead of hardcoding placeholder replacement in the engine, so workflow authors retain control over naming conventions.
  - Corrected the local control-panel build/restart command in `docs/ENGINE_TESTING.md` so it returns to the repository root after restarting the service.

## v0.4.21 (Released 2026-04-06)

- **Smart Heartbeat Monitor Automations**
  - Added a monitor-pattern compiler prompt and a native Control Panel triage-first DAG pattern to replace high-token polling with cheap `has_work: false` gating.
  - Added `metadata.triage_gate: true` support and transitive `triage_skipped` propagation to the automation runtime so skipped nodes bypass execution and finish cleanly.
  - Refactored `agent_standup_compose` into a broader composition factory that also supports `compose_monitor` creation.
  - Added "Smart scheduling" detection and UX hints in the control panel to guide operators toward monitor-style automations when their input describes background checking tasks.
  - Added the `assess` step type to allowed planner IDs.

- **Shared Workflow Context**
  - Added persisted context records plus publish/list/get/bind/revoke/supersede routes so approved shared workflow context can be published once and reused later with explicit bindings.
  - Added project allowlist visibility for Shared Workflow Context so explicit cross-project reuse can be opt-in instead of implied by default.
  - Added runtime expansion, scope-inspector surfacing, and control-panel binding flows so bound shared workflow contexts participate in automation runtime materialization instead of sitting only as metadata.
  - Added a Shared Workflow Context details drawer with provenance, freshness, manifest summaries, and bind history so operators can inspect reusable context before reuse.
  - Added copy-only suggestions for recent relevant shared workflow contexts in Scope Inspector, ranked by source-plan and title overlap, so operators can discover reuse candidates without auto-binding them.
  - Added superseded-context upgrade prompts in workflow review so existing bindings can be swapped to the replacement context with one click before saving.
  - Added explicit policy-hook events for publish, bind, revoke, and supersede so future authorization checks have a clear seam without introducing a new role model.
  - Added compile-time/runtime validation and regressions for revoked contexts, workspace mismatches, project mismatches, project-key list filtering, and scoped GET/read enforcement so the reuse path stays explicit and isolated.
  - Swept the shared-context UI copy to use Shared Workflow Context terminology consistently instead of the older pack wording.

- **Timezone-aware automation scheduling**
  - Added reusable timezone helpers and timezone pickers to both the control panel and desktop automation flows so new and edited schedules can reflect the operator's local timezone instead of silently defaulting to UTC.
  - Added timezone review details to automation previews so operators can verify the final schedule context before saving.

- **Tandem TUI mission-command modularization**
  - Moved the remaining higher-risk slash commands out of `app.rs` into `app/commands.rs`, including mission list/create/get/event flows, quick mission approval helpers, agent-team summary views, local bindings, agent-team approval reply helpers, preset index lookups, agent compose/summary/fork flows, automation preset summary/save flows, and agent-pane creation/switching/fanout orchestration commands.
  - Updated the TUI modularization kanban so the higher-risk slash-command extraction track is now complete and `TUI-201` is closed.
- **Tandem TUI plan-helper modularization**
  - Moved question-draft parsing, task-payload normalization, plan fingerprint/preview generation, plan-feedback markdown rendering, assistant-text extraction, reconstructed-task replay, and context-todo sync helpers out of `app.rs` into `app/plan_helpers.rs`.
  - Rewired both `app.rs` and `app/commands.rs` to consume the new helper module without changing plan-mode approval or task-sync behavior.

- **Agent team template library and standup composition**
  - Standardized agent-team template access around the global saved-agent workspace so standups can be composed from saved personalities even when the automation target workspace differs from the workspace where those templates were created.
  - Extended the standup compose client/server contract to carry an explicit `model_policy` onto every generated standup agent.

- **Workflow MCP discovery and connector-backed research**
  - Made workflow generation and execution explicitly surface MCP discovery when a prompt or node objective names connector-backed sources such as Reddit, GitHub issues, Slack, or Jira.
  - Added prompt guidance to call `mcp_list` before choosing connector-backed tools or falling back to generic web search, while keeping the injected MCP context compact instead of dumping the full registry into every prompt.
  - Added validation coverage so connector-backed work that never discovers available MCP tools is blocked instead of completing with guessed answers.
  - Added regression tests for planner prompt generation, runtime prompt rendering, and connector-backed intent detection.

- **Channel MCP permission refresh**
  - Reapplied the channel permission template whenever a Telegram, Discord, or Slack session is reused so `mcp_list` and other `mcp*` tools no longer get stuck behind stale session permissions after a restart.
  - Allowed session PATCH updates to refresh permission rules and added regression coverage so channel sessions can recover MCP discovery without manually recreating the session.

- **Agent standup startup reliability and explicit model selection**
  - Fixed automation-run startup so workflows that do not actually materialize runtime context can start and complete without being rejected for a missing runtime-context partition.
  - Fixed standup execution to resolve participant templates from the global saved-agent library when the composed automation runs in another workspace.
  - Added an explicit provider/model selector to the Agent Standup builder and now stamp that choice onto every standup participant plus the coordinator, preventing `MODEL_SELECTION_REQUIRED` failures in explicit-model environments.

## v0.4.20 (Released 2026-04-03)

- **Backend-backed coder planner sessions**
  - Added persisted planner-session records and session-scoped planner endpoints so one project can hold multiple independent coding plans instead of a single long thread.
  - Added a Chat-style session rail in the control panel with `New plan`, switch, rename, duplicate, and delete actions.
  - Added stale-plan recovery so expired `plan_id` drafts can be rehydrated from session state instead of leaving the coder planner stuck on 404s.
  - Added backend CRUD/recovery tests plus client smoke coverage for the new planner-session flow.

- **Tandem TUI exploration transcript summaries**
  - Added durable exploration transcript summaries so read/search/list tool bursts are preserved as compact operator-readable history instead of existing only in the live status strip.
  - Added exploration-batch accumulation, burst-boundary flushing, and target-change splitting so long exploration runs can emit multiple focused summaries as the AI moves between workspace targets.
  - Added an optional verbose exploration-summary fallback for debugging through `TANDEM_TUI_VERBOSE_EXPLORATION=1`, which surfaces deeper exploration target detail when needed.
  - Added focused regression and golden coverage for exploration summary wording and grouped-exploration rendering.

- **Tandem TUI structured edit transcript cells**
  - Added structured edit transcript cells for coding results with file-level summaries, aggregate and per-file add/remove counts, compact diff previews for tiny edits, and explicit applied/partial/failed states.
  - Added `Next` guidance blocks to edit transcript cells so operators can quickly review diffs, inspect failed edits, or retry when needed.
  - Added golden coverage for applied, partial, and failed edit summaries plus long-output truncation behavior.

- **Tandem TUI recent-command helper**
  - Added `/recent`, `/recent run <index>`, and `/recent clear` so terminal operators can reuse frequent slash commands without retyping them.
  - Added regression coverage for recent-command ordering, replay behavior, and clear semantics.

- **Tandem TUI transcript readability**
  - Improved transcript differentiation for tool-focused system messages and governance/operator-action-required messages with clearer badges.
  - Improved generic command/tool output rendering with stable head/tail truncation so transcript history stays readable during long runs.
  - Added structured rollback transcript cells for preview, execute, and receipt flows so guarded rollback work now follows one compact terminal UX pattern with action badges, concise summaries, and focused next steps.
  - Continued moving slash commands out of `app.rs` into `app/commands.rs`, including session flows, provider-key helpers, queue/error helpers, local agent-control commands, basic task/prompt/title chat commands, the routine-management command family, config/request-center/clipboard/permission reply helpers, and the context-run command family.

- **Installed desktop startup black-screen after vault unlock**
  - Added a timeout to installed-build sidecar release discovery so a stalled GitHub metadata lookup cannot hold the Tauri app on a black screen after passcode unlock.
  - Hardened startup routing after unlock so Tandem uses the actual configured workspace/provider state before deciding whether to show onboarding or chat.

- **Desktop automation loading and refresh responsiveness**
  - Stopped the main automation screen from blocking on provider, MCP, and tool catalog fetches during first load and refresh.
  - Moved Create-tab catalog loading to the background/on-demand path so Calendar, My Automations, and Live Tasks render sooner.
  - Replaced per-automation run-history fan-out with a single bulk runs request and fixed Windows absolute-path validation for automation workspace roots.

- **Desktop automation MCP and provider/model selection**
  - Updated automation setup to merge configured global and project MCP servers with runtime MCP status so connected configured servers appear in the Allowed MCP Servers picker.
  - Added fallback provider/model catalog loading from configured providers and discovered models so workflow and planner selectors can populate even when the runtime provider catalog is empty or late.

- **Desktop settings provider model search**
  - Expanded free-form provider model suggestions to merge live catalog results, current values, curated fallbacks, and discovered Ollama models.
  - Added native typeahead suggestion backing so typing a model name in settings surfaces the fuller provider model list expected from the control-panel experience.

## v0.4.19 (Released 2026-04-02)

- **Production desktop black-screen startup regression**
  - Fixed a release-build startup path where Tandem could load the frontend bundle but never mount React, leaving a blank black window after vault unlock.
  - React now mounts before persisted language-preference sync runs, so a slow or stuck settings-store roundtrip can no longer block the initial desktop UI.

## v0.4.18 (Released 2026-04-01)

- **Task intake and routing boundary**
  - Added a task-intake preview contract and HTTP endpoint so external orchestration can normalize single tasks, grouped tasks, and GitHub Project items before selecting coder or workflow paths.
  - Added task grouping signals, board-item normalization, and advisory route hints so grouped work can prefer mission preview without collapsing the mission planner into the coding loop.

- **Mission/workflow handoff hardening**
  - Added explicit execution-kind markers plus mission coder handoff summaries so mission and workflow nodes can distinguish coder-run work from governance-only steps.
  - Added regressions that preserve lane, phase, milestone, and launch metadata across the mission preview and task-routing boundaries.

- **Workflow knowledge reuse and rollout guidance**
  - Added first-class knowledge bindings, project-scoped preflight reuse, promotion lifecycle tracking, and audit reasons so workflows can reuse validated knowledge instead of redoing the same work.
  - Added planner and review guardrails that keep raw working state local, prefer project-scoped promoted knowledge, and surface rollout guidance for operators.

- **Desktop startup splash resilience**
  - Fixed the unlock splash so it dismisses immediately after a successful vault unlock instead of waiting on later provider discovery.
  - Stopped sidecar startup from silently rewriting selected-provider/default-provider state on boot, which reduces startup regressions caused by stale or slow provider config.
- **Context-run rollback audit and operator flow**
  - Added rollback history summary, last rollback outcome, and rollback policy metadata to context-run detail responses so clients can surface rollback readiness and audit state directly.
  - Added guarded rollback preview, receipt history, and execution workflows to the desktop developer run viewer, including policy acknowledgement and linked context-run refresh after execution.
  - Added Tandem TUI rollback preview, receipt history, explicit rollback execute, and execute-all commands so terminal operators can inspect and run guarded rollback steps from the TUI.

- **Engine build reliability**
  - Restored the `tandem-engine` fast-release build path by adding the `tandem-server` library surface expected by `tandem-ai`.
  - Re-exported the required server/runtime helpers through that new crate entrypoint so engine builds no longer fail on unresolved `tandem_server` imports.

## v0.4.17 (Released 2026-04-01)

- **Automation Modularization & Scaling**
  - Modularized the automation engine into dedicated sub-modules for improved maintainability.
  - Implemented a robust multi-run scheduler with capacity capping and workspace-root locking.
  - Added `PreexistingArtifactRegistry` (MWF-300) for efficient artifact reuse across retries.
  - Integrated provider-aware rate limiting into the scheduler admission flow.
  - Added observability for scheduler metrics, including active/queued counts and wait-time histograms.
  - Improved reliability with automatic panic and server-restart recovery for in-flight runs.

- **File Governance & Codebase Health**
  - Added codebase-wide line-count baseline generation in `docs/internal/file-size-baseline.csv`.
  - Added CI enforcement script to warn when touched files exceed the 1500-line threshold.

- **Workflow plan overlap review and auditable decisions**
  - Added overlap analysis to workflow-plan preview, chat, load, and apply responses so operators can see when a new plan matches or closely resembles prior work.
  - Added explicit overlap confirmation before apply when reuse/merge/fork/new decisions must be chosen, and persisted those decisions into overlap history for later audit.
  - Added overlap-history rendering in the workflow scope inspector so prior operator choices are searchable and visible in the UI.

- **Compiler-boundary cleanup for governed plan metadata**
  - Moved approved-plan materialization and manual-trigger record stamping into `tandem-plan-compiler`, keeping these plan-governance transforms under the compiler's licensed boundary instead of `tandem-server`.
  - Updated server callers to consume the compiler API for those transforms while leaving runtime/session/MCP concerns in the open-source host layer.

- **Governed context, bundle parity, and runtime compartmentalization**
  - Added a first-class `ContextObject` design for mission-scoped context with explicit scope, policy, freshness, provenance, and validation state.
  - Added runtime context-partition and credential-envelope handoff so routines inherit the right mission context without crossing execution boundaries.
  - Hardened bundle/export roundtrips so revision, scope snapshot, connector binding resolution, model routing, budget enforcement, and approved-plan materialization metadata travel together.

- **Operator visibility for approval, budget, routing, and bindings**
  - Added explicit inspector and calendar visibility for approval readiness, lifecycle state, budget hard-limit behavior, overlap history, and per-step model routing.
  - Added connector suggestion and edit affordances so unresolved bindings are surfaced as actionable work instead of being inferred silently.

- **Compiled mission preview visibility**
  - Added compiled mission-spec panels to desktop, control-panel, and template mission builders so operators can inspect mission identity, entrypoint, phases, milestones, and success criteria directly from preview.
  - Added compiled work-item cards showing assigned agent, dependencies, and phase/lane/milestone metadata to make the compiler output easier to validate before execution.

## v0.4.16 (Released 2026-03-25)

- Shared agent catalog for Tandem desktop and control panel
  - added a generated agent catalog sourced from `awesome-codex-subagents`
  - added shared browsing and reuse surfaces across desktop and control panel

- ACA-backed coding dashboard in the control panel
  - added authenticated `/api/aca/*` proxying with ACA bearer-token env support
  - added ACA-backed GitHub Project registration, intake preview, board refresh, and run launch from the coding page
  - added clearer separation between GitHub Project board state and ACA execution history
  - added ACA proxy and capability integration test coverage

- Calendar-first Automations workflow
  - added a weekly calendar view for automations with recurring-slot expansion, overlap stacking, and click-to-edit behavior
  - added drag-based rescheduling for simple cron-backed automation entries
  - added week-to-day drill-down, focused time-slot navigation, and `+N more` overlap counts so simultaneous automations are easier to inspect
  - added a guided schedule builder in create/edit flows for picking run times, weekdays, monthly dates, and repeat intervals without requiring cron knowledge
  - added a shared provider/model selector used across automation and mission-builder editors

- Desktop Tauri automation parity
  - added a new `Calendar` tab for workflow automations with week/day views, crowded-slot `+N more` handling, drill-down, and click-to-edit behavior
  - added drag-based rescheduling for simple cron-backed desktop calendar entries
  - added the guided schedule builder to desktop create and workflow edit flows so recurring schedules no longer require raw cron by default

- Control-panel workflow polish
  - renamed approvals/runtime wording to `Active Teams`
  - updated advanced mission builder token generation to use a browser-safe fallback helper
  - tightened coding-dashboard launch gating for non-launchable GitHub items
  - moved the custom OpenAI-compatible provider form into the normal provider catalog list in Settings
  - updated the Coding Workflows board to use the full width, with run detail and live logs moved below the board and collapsed by default
  - improved planner UX with visible loading state, disabled regenerate/revise actions while a request is running, and longer planner request timeouts
  - loosened workflow validation defaults so external-research and synthesis steps can complete with warnings instead of being blocked by local source-audit conventions
  - added explicit validation profiles plus `accepted_with_warnings` outcomes so usable automation artifacts can continue downstream while still surfacing validator warnings
  - improved workflow debugger blocker details with blocker category, prompt preflight budget, missing capabilities, MCP tool inventory, and per-node attempt evidence
  - treated engine restart/gateway failures as transient control-panel info states with retry-aware polling instead of always surfacing them as hard errors
  - tightened chat-panel/app-shell layout behavior for long transcripts and long route subtitles

- Faster local engine iteration
  - added a `fast-release` Cargo profile and updated engine-testing docs to prefer it for local rebuild/restart loops

- Automation runtime sandbox fix
  - fixed automation execution prompts to include inline node input metadata directly
  - added workspace-local default artifact paths for standard automation handoff nodes so they stop inventing `/tmp/...` temp files that the sandbox correctly blocks

- Workflow validator dead-end reductions
  - fixed citation-oriented and external-research workflow nodes so they no longer fail purely for missing `Files reviewed`-style sections when citations and web research are otherwise valid
  - updated workflow planner and mission-builder enforcement defaults to emit profile-appropriate hard requirements instead of one-size-fits-all research-brief blockers
  - added non-blocking warning visibility in automation task details so operators can distinguish “completed with warnings” from true repair/block states

- Automation MCP delivery availability and diagnostics
  - fixed automation MCP server selection so wildcard tool access and email-delivery nodes sync enabled MCP servers before tool/capability resolution instead of dropping to `Selected MCP servers: none`
  - expanded email-tool detection beyond `email`/`gmail` names and added diagnostics showing selected servers, remote MCP tools, registered tool-registry tools, and discovered/offered email-like tools when delivery is blocked

- Workflow board task projection consistency
  - fixed control-panel workflow task projection so blackboard tasks and context-run steps canonicalize onto the same workflow `node-*` ids
  - prevents the workflow board from showing duplicate pending/done versions of the same task, especially after retrying a downstream node

- Planner authentication failure clarity
  - fixed workflow planner revision failures to classify provider-auth errors like `User not found`, `unauthorized`, and invalid API keys explicitly instead of collapsing them into generic planner-response failures
  - aligned session dispatch error classification with those provider-auth failure signatures

## v0.4.15 (Released 2026-03-24)

- Control panel ACA/Hal900 optional integration
  - Added `/api/capabilities` endpoint with 45-second in-memory cache for ACA and engine capability detection
  - New `ACA_BASE_URL`, `ACA_HEALTH_PATH`, `ACA_PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS`, `ACA_CAPABILITY_CACHE_TTL_MS` environment variables configure ACA integration (defaults to absent)
  - ACA probe uses 5-second timeout with per-reason error counting (`aca_not_configured`, `aca_endpoint_not_found`, `aca_probe_timeout`, `aca_probe_error`, `aca_health_failed_xxx`)
  - Capability transitions are logged to console with ISO timestamps

- `useCapabilities` React Query hook
  - `useCapabilities()` hook with 60-second refetch and 30-second stale time
  - All ControlPanel queries are now gated on `coding_workflows === true` via React Query `enabled` flag
  - `CodingWorkflowsPage` shows a non-blocking callout when the engine is absent

- ACA-specific panels feature-flagged behind `aca_integration`
  - `AgentStandupBuilder` in `TeamsPage` is hidden when ACA is not connected
  - `AdvancedMissionBuilderPanel` in `AutomationsPage` shows a clear callout when ACA is absent; simple mode remains available
  - All other ControlPanel pages (Studio, MCP, Memory, Packs, Channels) remain fully functional when ACA is absent

- Observability and metrics instrumentation
  - `GET /api/capabilities/metrics` exposes `detect_duration_ms`, `detect_ok`, `last_detect_at_ms`, and `aca_probe_error_counts` by reason
  - `GET /api/system/orchestrator-metrics` exposes `streams_active`, `streams_total`, `events_received`, `stream_errors`
  - SSE client metrics available via `getSseMetrics()`: `channels.open`, `channels.total`, `events_received`, `errors_total`

- Unit and integration tests
  - `tests/capabilities.test.mjs` — 8 test cases covering all ACA/engine probe scenarios (all passing)
  - `tests/capabilities-integration.test.mjs` — integration tests for engine-up/ACA-absent and engine-down paths

- Load test scripts for run throughput and multi-worker fan-out
  - `scripts/loadtest/run_concurrency.mjs` — concurrent run concurrency test via session → run → SSE stream
  - `scripts/loadtest/run_fanout.mjs` — multi-mission multi-worker fan-out via agent-team/mission APIs

- Browser automation wait-contract fix and guide updates
  - fixed `browser_wait` so the engine accepts the documented nested `condition` shape plus common compatibility forms like `wait_for`, `waitFor`, camelCase fields, and top-level `selector`, `text`, or `url`
  - aligned the registered tool schema so agents and SDK callers see the same argument contract the engine accepts
  - added a dedicated guide section with copy-paste `browser_wait` examples for CLI and agent-driven QA flows

## v0.4.14 (Released 2026-03-23)

- Windows desktop startup hotfix for Tauri installs
  - fixed a Windows-specific storage flush path where startup metadata compaction could fail with `Access is denied. (os error 5)`
  - this failure surfaced as `ENGINE_STARTUP_FAILED` during `phase=runtime_init` and left the sidecar API in a startup-failed state for desktop clients
  - `tandem-core` now uses a Windows-safe file replacement fallback for storage JSON flushes when direct rename replacement is denied
  - added regression coverage for temp-file replacement over existing storage files
- Tauri orchestration list/count hotfix
  - context run listing now ignores unknown run types instead of treating them as orchestrator runs
  - the chat `ORCH` badge now counts only active `orchestrator` runs (`queued`/`planning`/`running`)
  - fixes inflated orchestration counts (for example showing `20 ORCH`) right after startup when no orchestrator run is active
- Custom OpenAI-compatible provider chat hotfix
  - OpenAI-compatible custom providers now normalize Tandem's internal prompt/context injection into one leading `system` message before `chat/completions` dispatch
  - fixes MiniMax-style custom-provider chat failures in the control panel where the engine previously sent multiple `system` messages and received errors like `invalid message role: system (2013)`
  - keeps custom providers on the standard OpenAI-compatible payload shape instead of requiring provider-specific message rewrites

## v0.4.13 (Released 2026-03-23)

- Remote MCP and channel secrets are now kept off persisted JSON config/state
  - remote MCP servers now support secret-backed headers alongside persisted non-secret headers, so bearer tokens and API keys can be materialized only at runtime
  - Telegram, Discord, and Slack bot tokens are now hoisted into Tandem's secure auth store instead of being left in plaintext config files
  - existing plaintext MCP auth headers and channel tokens are migrated off disk automatically on load

- The control panel can now configure real remote MCP header combinations
  - MCP settings now support arbitrary extra headers instead of forcing a single auth header shape
  - the built-in GitHub MCP pack now exposes a toolsets field and defaults `X-MCP-Toolsets` to `default`, making it possible to add `projects` and similar GitHub tool families from the UI
  - the built-in MCP catalog modal layout was fixed so server rows no longer get vertically squashed

- Provider Defaults now supports custom OpenAI-compatible providers in Settings
  - added control-panel and panel-template UI for custom provider IDs, base URLs, default models, optional API keys, and default-provider selection

## v0.4.12 (Released 2026-03-22)

- Custom provider support in the `tandem-engine` CLI is now practical for OpenAI-compatible endpoints
  - `run`, `serve`, and `parallel` now accept custom provider IDs instead of rejecting everything outside the built-in provider catalog
  - this unblocks engine-config-driven custom providers from being selected directly in headless/CLI workflows

- Explicit OpenAI-compatible base URLs are no longer stomped by env auth bootstrap
  - if a provider already has a configured `url`, setting an API key env var no longer rewrites that provider back to its built-in default endpoint
  - fixes headless cases where custom endpoints like MiniMax could be silently redirected back to OpenAI when `OPENAI_API_KEY` was present

## v0.4.11 (Released 2026-03-22)

- Channel tool scope controls for Telegram, Discord, and Slack
  - added persisted per-channel tool preferences for built-in tools and MCP servers used by channel-created sessions
  - added desktop Settings controls plus control-panel/template settings for managing channel tool scope
  - added TypeScript and Python SDK support for channel security-profile fields, channel verification, and channel tool-preference reads and updates

- Public channel security profiles for Telegram, Discord, and Slack
  - added per-channel `security_profile` support across channel config, server/API responses, desktop settings, and panel settings
  - added a hardened `public_demo` profile for public-facing integrations that blocks file/workspace access, shell access, MCP access, model/config/operator commands, and tool-scope widening
  - `/help` in `public_demo` channels now includes a disabled-for-security section so users can see Tandem supports richer capabilities in trusted channels
  - added quarantined public memory for `public_demo`, scoped to a channel-specific public namespace instead of trusted project/global memory
  - moved public `/memory` commands onto the same semantic-memory backend used by engine memory tools so public reads, writes, and deletes stay inside the same quarantine boundary

- Post-release desktop/docs follow-ups
  - fixed the desktop sidecar/orchestrator follow-ups required by the new channel session `project_id` contract
  - updated docs parity coverage for the new `memory_delete` tool

## v0.4.10 (Released 2026-03-21)

- Initial Coding Workflows view in the control panel
  - added a new `Coding` section in the navigation
  - added an early Coding Workflows dashboard for internal run visibility, board-style workflow summaries, manual-task scaffolding, and integrations visibility

- GitHub Projects MCP bootstrap polish
  - documented the Tandem-native GitHub MCP path more clearly so GitHub Projects can connect through PAT-backed MCP bootstrap instead of relying on a separate `gh` login flow
  - tightened the engine-first guidance around GitHub Projects so future client work layers on top of Tandem’s built-in MCP path

- Control-panel packaging and self-hosting improvements
  - added Dockerfiles, entrypoints, and `docker-compose` support for the control panel and engine
  - the control-panel package now ships the runtime `lib/` and `server/` files its CLI depends on, avoiding incomplete installs

## v0.4.9 (Released 2026-03-21)

- GitHub Projects can now feed Tandem Coder directly as an engine-owned intake path
  - added project-scoped coder binding APIs so one Tandem coder project can be connected to one GitHub Project with discovered schema, saved status mapping, and schema fingerprint tracking
  - added GitHub Project inbox and intake APIs so issue-backed TODO items can be listed and turned into Tandem-native `issue_triage` coder runs without external shell-script setup
  - added MCP-backed GitHub Project capability resolution, schema-drift detection, idempotent project-item intake, and outward remote-sync-state tracking so Tandem remains the execution authority after intake
  - added desktop Coder UI for connecting a GitHub Project, reviewing actionable and unsupported inbox items, intaking items into coder, and inspecting GitHub Project linkage from the run detail view
  - added TypeScript and Python SDK support plus engine-testing and SDK docs for the new binding, inbox, and intake flows

- AutoResearch workflow optimization now has first-pass product and SDK surfaces
  - the Tandem AutoResearch adaptation is explicitly inspired by Andrej Karpathy's `karpathy/autoresearch`, but adapted here for validator-backed workflow optimization instead of direct Python training-loop mutation
  - added optimization campaign list and experiment-list HTTP surfaces plus an explicit approved-winner apply route
  - added optimization support to the TypeScript and Python SDKs so campaigns, experiments, actions, and winner-apply flows can be driven from clients instead of raw HTTP only
  - added an `Optimize` tab under Automations in the control panel with campaign creation, campaign detail, experiment inspection, and approve/reject/apply controls
  - approved winners now persist a structured apply patch and can be applied back to the saved live workflow with targeted drift checks plus audit metadata on the workflow record
  - optimization campaigns can now reconcile completed baseline replay runs automatically, record replay metrics, queue follow-up baseline runs when required, and promote themselves into `running` once a stable phase-1 baseline is established
  - after a stable baseline is established, campaigns can now generate one bounded deterministic candidate, queue its eval run, ingest the completed run metrics, and surface a promotion recommendation without manually creating experiment records first
  - unattended candidate evaluation now enforces `max_consecutive_failures`, so campaigns stop instead of searching forever when repeated candidate evals fail

- Added a new top-level `Studio` workflow builder in the control panel
  - template-first multi-agent workflow creation with editable role prompts, stage/dependency editing, saved Studio workflows, and a shared workspace picker
  - direct save/run flows into `automation_v2`
  - bundled research-heavy Studio templates now use explicit discover, local-source, external-research, and finalize stages so research and writing are no longer overloaded into one node
  - saved workflows created from those bundled templates now auto-migrate in place to `workflow_structure_version = 2` while preserving automation ids and the original final research node ids
  - final staged research writers now validate against upstream evidence handoffs instead of forcing same-node `read`/`websearch` work to be repeated during the final artifact write

- Workflow run debugging and recovery are much stronger
  - workflow board now gets its own row and desktop lanes can be horizontally scrolled with jump-to-active controls
  - blocked/failed runs now expose `Continue`, `Continue From Here`, `Retry`, and `Retry Workflow`
  - task details now show semantic node status, blocked reason, approval, tool telemetry, and artifact-validation results
  - coding task details now show per-step verification results, and successfully verified code nodes finish as `done` instead of generic `completed`
  - failed automation runs now preserve the latest linked session id so the debugger can still surface transcript context after a node failure
  - workflow nodes now expose typed stability metadata (`workflow_class`, `phase`, `failure_kind`, and artifact candidates) so the debugger can rely less on transcript parsing
  - workflow lifecycle history now includes typed node-scoped stability events for artifact acceptance/rejection, research coverage failures, and verification/repair transitions
  - desktop/TUI coder summaries now include typed workflow stability fields and recent workflow events per task so task inspectors can follow the same backend state contract
  - Studio saved workflows now show the latest run’s typed stability snapshot for faster authoring/debugging loops
  - artifact finalization now deterministically selects the strongest candidate from verified output, session writes, and preexisting output instead of relying on placeholder-phrase rejection
  - Studio and the Run Debugger now share workflow-stability selectors instead of reimplementing node-output and lifecycle parsing separately
  - more control-panel workflow views now use the shared workflow-stability selector layer for session IDs, latest stability snapshots, node-output text, and telemetry extraction
  - desktop agent-automation views now reuse the shared coder workflow-run parsers for session IDs and node outputs instead of duplicating local extraction logic
  - shared desktop coder workflow-run helpers now also normalize checkpoint and lifecycle-history access so agent-automation views stop hand-rolling those workflow records
  - shared desktop coder workflow-run helpers now also provide completed/pending/blocked node IDs plus gate and failure access so agent-automation diagnostics use one checkpoint contract
  - shared desktop coder detail views now also read gate state through the same workflow-run helper contract instead of reaching into checkpoint payloads directly
  - shared desktop coder workflow-run helpers now also provide usage metrics and summary text so agent-automation views can drop more local checkpoint/detail parsing
  - shared desktop coder workflow-run helpers now also own run display titles and failed-run recovery checks so agent-automation views stop duplicating that workflow logic
  - shared desktop coder workflow-run helpers now also provide status-label formatting so agent-automation views stop carrying their own run-status mapping
  - shared desktop coder workflow-run helpers now also provide node-output summaries and session-id extraction so agent-automation diagnostics stop hand-parsing output payloads
  - shared desktop coder workflow-run helpers now also provide stop-reason and node-attempt helpers so agent-automation views drop more direct run/checkpoint field access
  - shared desktop coder workflow-run helpers now also provide blocker extraction so desktop automation and coder detail views surface the same run issues
  - added initial canonical workflow smoke coverage in `tandem-server` HTTP integration tests for research, artifact, and coding workflow state contracts
  - shared desktop workflow-run helpers now also normalize lifecycle-derived recovery, failure-chain, promotion, and repair event slices so agent-automation views stop reimplementing workflow-event filtering
  - shared workflow-event summary helpers now normalize phase, failure-kind, and fallback reason rendering across the control-panel debugger and desktop developer inspector
  - shared control-panel workflow selectors now own completed, blocked, and pending node-id extraction so `AutomationsPage` stops hand-parsing checkpoint node arrays
  - shared control-panel workflow selectors now also own workflow task-state calculation plus completed/pending node counts so `AutomationsPage` drops more page-local checkpoint logic
  - shared control-panel workflow selectors now also own active-session counts so workflow headers stop reading session arrays directly

  - shared control-panel workflow selectors now also own the checkpoint-based workflow board projection so `AutomationsPage` no longer rebuilds task rows inline
  - shared control-panel workflow selectors now also own the first-pending-task fallback used by active workflow focus detection
  - shared control-panel workflow selectors now also own blocked-node counts so debugger headers and summary rows stop counting blocked arrays inline
  - control-panel workflow focus detection now prefers typed lifecycle node events from the shared workflow stability contract before falling back to transcript/session-text inference
  - control-panel task inspection now consumes pre-normalized recent workflow event summaries from the shared workflow stability layer instead of re-summarizing raw lifecycle entries inline
  - workflow run-history normalization for context events, blackboard patches, and persisted run events now lives in the shared workflow stability layer instead of `AutomationsPage`
  - workflow debugger telemetry seed normalization for persisted and context events now lives in the shared workflow stability layer instead of `AutomationsPage`
  - control-panel workflow event accessors for run ids, event types, timestamps, and reason text now live in the shared workflow stability layer instead of `AutomationsPage`
  - control-panel live session/event log rows now use shared workflow session-event normalization instead of being shaped inline in `AutomationsPage`
  - event-derived workflow blocker classification now lives in the shared workflow stability layer instead of `AutomationsPage`
  - control-panel workflow telemetry rows now use shared workflow event display normalization instead of formatting raw event payloads inline
  - control-panel workflow task inspection now consumes a shared normalized artifact/research/verification detail object instead of deriving those fields through long page-local `useMemo` chains

- Repo coding backlog workflows now have real task operations
  - projected backlog items can now be claimed and manually requeued through `automation_v2` run APIs
  - stale `in_progress` backlog-task leases are automatically requeued by the shared context-task runtime before the next claim
  - the Run Debugger now shows lease expiry / stale state and exposes backlog `Claim Task` / `Requeue Backlog Task` actions
  - overlapping code-task write scopes are now filtered out of the same runnable batch so parallel coding workflows stay conservative by default

- Session and coder runtime journaling are converging on one durable model
  - interactive session runs now create deterministic `session-<sessionID>` context runs before `contextRunID` is returned
  - a session context-run journal bridge now records session run lifecycle and tool activity as replayable context-run events
  - coder worker-session artifacts and approval/review payloads now carry durable worker-session context-run ids alongside transient session identifiers
  - routine, legacy automation, and `automation_v2` operator routes now only return canonical `contextRunID` links after the journal/blackboard projection is synced, so returned links are immediately dereferenceable

- File-backed workflow runtime hardening
  - `automation_v2` nodes now use deterministic required tool sets
  - workflow tool normalization now gives `read` workflows `glob` for discovery
  - built-in `websearch` now supports backend selection via `TANDEM_SEARCH_BACKEND`, with a Tandem-hosted default route plus direct `brave`, `exa`, and self-hosted `searxng` overrides
  - official Linux setup now writes search defaults into `/etc/tandem/engine.env`, including `TANDEM_SEARCH_BACKEND=tandem`, `TANDEM_SEARCH_URL`, and optional direct-provider override keys for later use
  - web-research failures now degrade more cleanly when the configured backend is unavailable, so research workflows can continue local-only instead of looping on dead search calls
  - write-required workflow retries now force the first missing artifact write instead of continuing to offer discovery tools before any declared output exists
  - `/workspace/...` file tool paths now resolve against the real workspace root
  - blocked node outcomes now stop descendants instead of letting downstream stages fabricate blocked handoffs
  - research briefs that cite local sources without any `read` calls now block instead of slipping through as “completed”
  - timed-out `websearch` attempts no longer count as successful external research for workflows that require current market evidence
  - brief/research nodes now require concrete `read` coverage, successful web research when expected, and get one automatic repair pass before they finalize as blocked
  - blocked research nodes now expose structured coverage/debug metadata including actual `read` paths, discovered relevant files, missing file coverage, and repair-pass state
  - evidence-gated artifact nodes now emit structured repair attempt metadata, get bounded repair retries after premature writes, and terminate with explicit `PREWRITE_REQUIREMENTS_EXHAUSTED` blocked state when those retries are exhausted
  - evidence-repair passes now temporarily remove `write` tools and expose only the still-missing inspection/research tools, so nodes that wrote too early must gather the missing evidence before the next write pass
  - repair followups that still skip the required reads or web research now stay inside the repair loop instead of bouncing straight back into another write-required retry
  - research/editorial artifact validation now propagates repair-attempt counts, attempts remaining, and exhaustion state into `artifact_validation`, validator summaries, and workflow lifecycle events
  - research brief workflows now default to warning-only source coverage gaps; hard blocking and repair enforcement only apply when a node explicitly opts into `metadata.builder.source_coverage_required = true`
  - `automation_v2` terminal run status now derives from blocked/failed node outputs instead of trusting checkpoint `blocked_nodes` alone, so blocked research nodes no longer show up as completed runs
  - the control-panel Run Debugger now derives blocked/failed run status from node outputs as a guardrail and shows repair-attempt progress when the backend status and task board disagree
  - code workflows now support multi-step build/test/lint verification summaries, with partial verification blocking completion and failed verification surfacing as `verify_failed`
  - the Automations Tasks tab now reads workflow runs from a canonical `/automations/v2/runs` all-runs API, so mirrored workflow runs no longer disappear just because they were not discovered through the saved workflow-definition list
  - blocked workflow runs now surface as task issues in the Tasks tab instead of being silently excluded from the failed-run bucket
  - fixed an `AutomationsPage` runtime render regression where stale `eventType`/`eventReason`/`eventAt` references crashed the Tasks tab and left the page appearing empty and non-interactive
  - fixed a second `AutomationsPage` runtime render regression where a stale `buildWorkflowProjectionFromRunSnapshot` reference crashed opening historical workflow tasks and runs

- Managed worktree isolation is now runtime-owned
  - `.tandem/worktrees` now acts as a manager-owned allocation area with deterministic paths, lease validation, cleanup on release/expiry, and managed-path boundary enforcement
  - coder workers and `agent_teams` child sessions now use manager-issued isolated worktrees for real git repos
  - failure-path cleanup now removes managed worktrees even when setup fails before the normal teardown

- Workflow outputs now use explicit validator contracts
  - `automation_v2` output contracts now declare validator kinds explicitly and node outputs persist typed validator summaries
  - mission builder, workflow planner, and standup composer now emit explicit research/review/structured/generic validator intent
  - `automation_v2` read APIs normalize older node outputs to the current validator contract so operator views converge on one interpretation
  - research brief validation now treats citation presence and `Web sources reviewed` structure as first-class source-coverage requirements, emits typed `citations_missing` / `web_sources_reviewed_missing` unmet requirements, and surfaces citation/source summary fields directly in `artifact_validation` and `automation_v2` run payloads
  - workflow planner and mission builder now preserve explicit `metadata.builder.web_research_expected` intent into compiled `AutomationV2Spec` research nodes, and both authoring paths backfill that metadata for research brief steps so web-source coverage expectations are declared in authoring metadata instead of only inferred at validation time
  - `GenericArtifact` validation now blocks weak `report_markdown` and `text_summary` outputs with explicit editorial unmet requirements, typed `editorial_quality_failed` failures, `editorial_validation` phase classification, and structural summary fields like heading/paragraph counts in `artifact_validation`
  - publish/outbound nodes now inherit upstream editorial failure as a runtime-owned `editorial_clearance_required` block, and external-action receipts are skipped while that publish QA block is active

- Outbound side effects now have a shared runtime receipt path
  - added a shared `ExternalActionRecord` plus `/external-actions` APIs for outbound action receipts, targets, approval state, idempotency keys, and receipt metadata
  - Bug Monitor GitHub publish/failure receipts now mirror into that shared path, publish falls back to directly discovered MCP GitHub tools when bindings lag, duplicate publish reuses the prior receipt, and read-only recheck is no longer blocked by the fail-closed posting gate
  - coder real PR submit and merge submit now also emit shared external-action receipts linked back to the canonical coder context run
  - workflow hook and manual workflow actions now emit the same shared receipts when their `tool:` or `capability:` action resolves to a bound outbound capability, and those receipts are linked back to the canonical workflow context run
  - publish-style `automation_v2` nodes now emit the same shared receipts for successful bound outbound tool calls, and those receipts are linked back to the canonical automation context run and included in node outputs
  - scheduled `automation_v2` runs now sync their canonical context runs before any outbound receipt is persisted, so receipt links are immediately dereferenceable even when the scheduler created the run
  - retried `automation_v2` publish nodes now include attempt-aware receipt identity, so external-action history preserves each retry instead of collapsing multiple attempts into one record

- Skill workflow compilation now exposes the shared runtime spec
  - `skills_compile` now emits an additive `automation_preview` for installed skill workflows by compiling `workflow.yaml` recipes through the shared `WorkflowPlan -> AutomationV2Spec` path
  - installed `pack_builder_recipe` skills now expose the same runtime-spec preview shape as mission builder and workflow planner instead of stopping at an abstract execution summary
  - workflow registry list/get surfaces now also expose additive `automation_preview` payloads compiled through the same shared plan compiler
  - pack-builder apply now persists a mirrored `AutomationV2Spec` alongside the existing routine wrapper, returns the registered automation ids in its apply result, and keeps that mirrored automation paused until the routine wrapper delegates into the canonical runtime so one pack does not register two active schedules
  - manual workflow runs and workflow-hook dispatches now mirror into linked `automation_v2` specs/runs, and workflow run records surface `automation_id` / `automation_run_id` so operators can jump straight into the canonical runtime

- Artifact integrity protections for workflow outputs
  - placeholder/status-note overwrites no longer silently replace declared output artifacts
  - undeclared touch/status/marker files are rejected and cleaned up
  - substantive blocked artifacts remain on disk for inspection
  - fresh workflow reruns now preserve prior declared outputs until a replacement artifact is actually produced, so a failed retry does not leave the workspace empty
  - when a later placeholder write overwrites a real earlier write in the same node, the engine now restores the best substantive write from session history
  - malformed streamed write calls now preserve arg previews, recover normalized best-effort args on failure, upgrade persisted tool args when better structured evidence arrives, and keep recovered write lineage visible in session replay

- Workflow Studio model selection is now aligned with the rest of the app
  - per-agent workflow models now use provider-backed selectors instead of raw text inputs
  - workflows can optionally use one shared provider/model across all agents to keep multi-agent runs cheaper

- Saved Studio workflow deletion finally persists across restarts
  - deleting an `automation_v2` workflow now also deletes its stored run history so old run snapshots cannot recreate deleted workflows on engine boot

- Control-panel repo-source docs were corrected
  - README service/init commands now show the right paths both from the repo root and from inside `packages/tandem-control-panel`

- Channel/browser reliability and agent context packaging
  - channel-created sessions now pre-approve browser tools and `mcp*` namespaces so channel operators do not get stuck on invisible approval prompts
  - wildcard permission matching now works for namespaced permissions like `mcp*`
  - browser sidecar env/profile handling was hardened for cleaner launches
  - added bundled component-manifest agent context resources for Tandem engine, desktop, TUI, control panel, and SDK clients

## v0.4.7 (Released)

- Channel memory now works end-to-end across fresh Telegram/Discord/Slack sessions
  - fresh channel sessions now get `memory_search`, `memory_store`, and `memory_list` by default instead of stalling on permission requests
  - completed channel replies archive exact user-visible user/assistant exchanges into global retrieval memory while keeping the full transcript in session storage
  - archived exchanges dedupe by session/message provenance so retries do not create duplicate global rows forever
  - slash commands and `ENGINE_ERROR:` assistant replies are excluded from archival so recall stays focused on real conversation history
  - fresh `/new` channel sessions can now recall prior archived exchanges from global memory on the standard Tandem storage layout

- Channel slash commands now expose workflow planning directly in chat
  - `/help` now shows grouped command categories and `/help schedule` explains workflow-planning commands
  - added `/schedule plan`, `/schedule show`, `/schedule edit`, `/schedule reset`, and `/schedule apply` for in-channel workflow drafting and automation creation
  - `/schedule` now acts as a discoverable guided entry point for automation setup instead of requiring users to know the workflow-plan API
  - the dispatcher forwards the active session workspace root to the workflow planner when available so drafts target the correct repo/project by default
  - added namespaced operator commands for `/automations`, `/runs`, `/memory`, `/workspace`, `/mcp`, `/packs`, and `/config`
  - added topic help via `/help automations`, `/help runs`, `/help memory`, `/help workspace`, `/help mcp`, `/help packs`, and `/help config`
  - destructive channel commands now require explicit `--yes`, while list/show/search/control commands execute directly

- Memory safety and reliability fixes
  - hardened memory tools so public tool calls can no longer override the memory DB path with arbitrary `db_path` values
  - fixed `memory_list tier=global` decoding against `global_memory_chunks`, including the broken `token_count` column/index path
  - fixed channel archival to write to the same memory DB path that `memory_search` and `memory_list` read from
  - added regression coverage for DB-path resolution, global row decoding, and deduped `chat_exchange` archival

- Storage root standardization
  - standard installs now treat `TANDEM_STATE_DIR` as the canonical Tandem storage root for memory, config, logs, and session storage
  - shared-path resolution now falls back to `TANDEM_STATE_DIR` before OS defaults, preventing split installs where `memory.sqlite` lands in a second directory
  - setup helpers and example env files no longer write `TANDEM_MEMORY_DB_PATH` by default; it remains an advanced override only
  - engine startup now warns when `TANDEM_STATE_DIR` and `TANDEM_MEMORY_DB_PATH` are split, making storage drift easier to diagnose

## v0.4.6 (Released)

- Advanced Swarm Builder for coordinated multi-agent missions
  - Added a new advanced mission builder on top of `AutomationV2Spec` for orchestrated swarm-style workloads instead of only the simple workflow wizard.
  - Added mission blueprints with mission goal, shared context, workstreams, dependencies, output contracts, review stages, approval gates, and reusable per-role agent/model selection.

  - Added compile preview, validation warnings, graph summaries, and stronger grouped dependency visualization for advanced missions.

- Web control-panel parity for advanced mission creation
  - Added a native control-panel advanced builder so the browser `/automations` surface can create and edit advanced mission automations alongside the desktop app.
  - Added a how-it-works modal, inline field guidance, and AI/workflow/agentic starter mission presets in the web UI.
  - Moved starter presets out of the TSX component into external preset files for easier review and reuse.
  - Clarified current preset scope: mission-builder starter presets are still a local bundled shelf for validation, while persisted workspace-backed template storage already exists for agent-team templates.

- Desktop Coder workspace for coding swarms
  - Turned the desktop `Developer` destination into `Coder` and made it the visible home for coding-swarm creation and operations.
  - Added a dedicated Coder workspace with `Create` and `Runs` tabs instead of a legacy run-inspector-only screen.
  - Embedded coding-swarm creation in Coder on top of the existing advanced mission builder and mission compile/apply flow, rather than creating a second orchestration system.
  - Added coding presets, user-repo context detection, and a lightweight local saved-template shelf in the Coder create flow.
  - Added automation-backed Coder run projection so coder-tagged Automation V2 runs show up directly in the Coder run list.
  - Added operator tabs for coder runs covering overview, transcripts, context, artifacts, and memory, plus direct cross-links into Agent Automation and Command Center.

- Automation V2 recovery, observability, and execution hardening
  - Added clearer stop/pause/recover semantics, branch-local repair and rework handling, richer per-step diagnostics, and milestone promotion history for advanced automation runs.
  - Fixed advanced-builder schedule payloads to use the tagged `misfire_policy` shape expected by the server.
  - Fixed external mission preset loading in the control panel.
  - Fixed an engine panic during malformed automation node execution and converted node panics into normal run failures so stuck runs surface truthfully.
  - Fixed Telegram/Slack/Discord bots failing to reply after saving channel settings with a blank Allowed Users field by normalizing empty allowlists to wildcard `["*"]`.
  - Fixed memory regression in storage layer that caused engine to use 1.5-2.7 GiB instead of ~200 MiB by removing snapshot accumulation on routine message/tool updates and adding atomic writes with temp-file rename

- Coder and automation integration cleanup
  - Added typed coder metadata so coder-originated missions stay on the existing `MissionBlueprint` and `AutomationV2` contracts.
  - Switched the desktop Coder run detail path to consume explicit backend-linked context run IDs instead of synthesizing them locally.
  - Added active user-repo context binding for coder missions, including detected repo root, remote slug, current branch, and default branch.
  - Extracted shared coder run list, detail, and operator controls so the Coder workspace reuses components instead of embedding whole legacy pages.

## v0.4.5 (Released 2026-03-10)

- Workflow automation editor and run debugger improvements
  - Expanded the workflow edit modal into a large editor with dedicated prompt editing for workflow step objectives.
  - Added explicit workflow tool access controls in both the creation wizard and edit modal: `All tools` or `Custom allowlist`.
  - Surfaced selected tool access in the wizard review step before deploy.
  - Improved run debugger sizing and scrolling so the workflow board can grow instead of being cut off in the modal.
  - Fixed right-rail blocker/failure card cropping and reduced lower log-panel height pressure so live workflow boards remain visible.
  - Tightened workflow prompt-editor cards by removing duplicated step text and redundant labels.
  - Made the final workflow review step easier to read by collapsing long plan/prompt text into expandable markdown previews.

- Workflow automation engine/planner integration fixes
  - Fixed workflow automation save payloads to use the server-required tagged `misfire_policy` shape.
  - Updated workflow-plan apply so new workflow automations honor `tool_access_mode` and `tool_allowlist` from operator preferences.
  - Made workflow tool access explicit instead of relying on the old hidden narrow allowlist behavior.
  - Fixed duplicate workflow automation list rows in the control panel by normalizing Automation V2 list rendering by id.
  - Hardened the engine loop so malformed tool calls get bounded inline self-repair retries before burning workflow node attempts.
  - Added targeted malformed-tool recovery guidance for empty `bash`, missing `webfetch` URL, and missing file/write arguments.

- Registry publish fix for the TypeScript client
  - Fixed `@frumu/tandem-client` publish builds by restoring missing `AgentStandupComposeInput` and `AgentStandupComposeResponse` imports.

## v0.4.4 (Released 2026-03-09)

- Official control-panel bootstrap path for headless installs
  - Added a real `tandem-setup` CLI with `init`, `doctor`, `service`, `pair mobile`, and `run`.
  - Added shared bootstrap/setup modules for canonical env paths, env creation, engine-config bootstrap, and diagnostics.
  - Added cross-platform service generation for Linux `systemd` and macOS `launchd`.
  - Added a shared `service-runner` entrypoint so managed services start through the same env-loading contract.
  - Added focused tests for bootstrap env generation, `systemd` units, `launchd` plists, and `doctor`.

- Agent standups, reusable agent personalities, and workspace memory defaults
  - Added reusable agent personalities in the control panel with persistent prompts, default models, and avatar upload.
  - Added server-side standup workflow composition on top of Automation V2 using saved agent personalities.
  - Added workspace-aware memory defaults so chats and automations can use `memory_search`, `memory_store`, and `memory_list` without manually supplying `session_id` or `project_id`.
  - Added deterministic `project_id` binding for workspace-backed sessions to improve recall across prior conversations in the same workspace.
  - Updated standup workflows to combine memory recall with workspace inspection through `glob`, `grep`, and `read`.

- Control-panel runtime/bootstrap refinements
  - Made `tandem-setup init` the documented bootstrap path while keeping legacy `tandem-control-panel --init` compatibility.
  - Switched official bootstrap to canonical OS config/data paths instead of relying on cwd `.env`.
  - Added `TANDEM_CONTROL_PANEL_HOST`, `TANDEM_CONTROL_PANEL_PUBLIC_URL`, and canonical control-panel state-dir support for future gateway/mobile pairing.
  - Updated the runtime to bind explicitly to the configured panel host and load managed env files before startup.
  - Updated package/docs/example guidance so headless installs flow through the control-panel gateway layer instead of the old quickstart bootstrap path.

- Automation V2 save reliability after storage migration
  - Fixed `WORKFLOW_PLAN_APPLY_FAILED` automation save failures caused by persistence verification treating stale legacy `automations_v2.json` migration files as authoritative.
  - Kept save verification strict on the active canonical automation file and downgraded stale fallback-file mismatches to warnings.
  - Added regression coverage for successful automation save/apply when a stale legacy automation file is still present.

## v0.4.3 (Unreleased)

- Automation V2 restart persistence is fixed.
  - Fixed an engine startup race that could overwrite saved automations with `{}` before persisted definitions were loaded.
  - Moved Automation V2 canonical storage into the Tandem global `data/` directory, with legacy root-level files kept as migration fallback on load.
  - Added persistence verification, startup diagnostics, and recovery from run snapshots when definition files are missing.

- Tandem TUI coding-agent workflow upgrades
  - Added coding-first keyboard shortcuts:
    - `Alt+P` opens workspace file search and inserts `@path` references into the active composer.
    - `Alt+D` opens a scrollable git diff overlay for reviewing local changes in-place.
    - `Alt+E` opens the active composer text in `$VISUAL` / `$EDITOR` and writes edited content back into the TUI.
  - Added matching slash commands:
    - `/files [query]`
    - `/diff`
    - `/edit`
  - Added dedicated coding workflow overlays:
    - file-search modal with keyboard navigation and quick insert
    - pager modal with line/page scrolling for long content
  - Improved tool-call and tool-result transcript rendering to show clearer multi-line execution cells during coding sessions.
  - Updated Tandem TUI docs/help surfaces with the new coding workflow keys and commands.

- Desktop orchestrator + command center stabilization
  - Fixed orchestrator resume so runs with no tasks re-enter planning instead of getting stuck trying to execute an empty plan.
  - Restored run-list visibility across mixed storage by merging context runs with legacy local orchestrator runs.
  - Hardened run deletion for context runs by removing shared `data/context_runs/<run_id>` state and surfacing real delete failures.
  - Replaced native desktop `window.confirm` prompts in orchestrator controls with in-app confirmation dialogs.
  - Added in-app toast surfacing for payment/quota failures (`payment required`, credit-limit style provider errors).
  - Tuned planner guidance so non-trivial report/objective requests avoid collapsing into a single task.
  - Reduced terminal log spam by suppressing duplicate in-flight `tool.lifecycle.start` events for the same tool part even when provider args stream updates.
  - Fixed command center action visibility so selected runs reliably expose pause/cancel/continue/delete controls.
  - Fixed validator/retry mismatch where write-intended tasks could be treated as non-writing and loop into `Max retries exceeded` with `no changed-file evidence`; retries now escalate to strict-write when validator feedback proves no workspace changes.

- Bug Monitor settings foundation and server config/status surface
  - Added persisted bug-monitor config in `tandem-server` for repo, selected MCP server, provider preference, and dedicated `model_policy.default_model` routing.
  - Added fail-closed readiness/status evaluation for selected model availability, MCP connectivity, and required GitHub capabilities.
  - Fixed the Bug Monitor settings-page initialization crash caused by early query access.
  - Changed reporter model selection to allow typed/manual model IDs with provider-backed suggestions, and fixed model persistence across reloads.
  - Generalized GitHub MCP capability readiness so arbitrary MCP server instance names can satisfy reporter issue capabilities.
  - Added reporter HTTP endpoints:
    - `GET /config/bug-monitor`

- Tandem Coder memory promotion guardrails
  - Hardened coder-side promotion rules for newer memory kinds before they enter governed memory.
  - `duplicate_linkage` promotion now requires both linked issue and linked PR numbers.
  - `regression_signal` promotion now requires structured regression entries plus supporting evidence artifacts.
  - Generic terminal `run_outcome` backfills are no longer promotable without workflow evidence artifacts.
  - PR review and merge follow-on runs now persist their own `duplicate_linkage` candidates from parent issue-fix runs instead of relying only on the original PR submit artifact.
  - Failed issue-triage reproduction now also emits `regression_signal` memory, so post-failure analysis is not limited to Bug Monitor triage.
  - Failed issue-fix validation now also emits `regression_signal` memory with the failing validation evidence.
  - Issue-fix worker-session failures now also emit rich `run_outcome` memory with worker artifact and session context.
  - Issue-triage, PR-review, and merge-recommendation worker-session failures now also emit rich `run_outcome` memory with worker artifact and session context.
  - Issue-fix retrieval now prioritizes `regression_signal` memory so failed validation history can influence later fixes across related issues.
    - `PATCH /config/bug-monitor`
    - `GET /bug-monitor/status`
    - `GET /bug-monitor/drafts`
    - `GET /bug-monitor/drafts/{id}`
  - Control-panel Settings now has a dedicated `Bug Monitor` tab with repo/MCP/provider/model selection, readiness indicators, and recent draft visibility.
  - Added `#/bug-monitor` as the canonical route for direct access to the Bug Monitor settings surface.
  - Desktop Settings now has a matching engine-backed `Bug Monitor` card with MCP deep-linking and recent draft visibility.
  - Added a Tauri bridge for reporter config, status, draft listing, draft lookup, and manual draft submission.
  - Added `POST /bug-monitor/report` so desktop logs and failed orchestrator runs can create deduped local issue drafts through the engine.
  - Fixed the desktop sidecar reporter config path to use the canonical `GET/PATCH /config/bug-monitor` route.
  - Added engine-backed draft approval/deny actions at `POST /bug-monitor/drafts/{id}/approve` and `POST /bug-monitor/drafts/{id}/deny`, and surfaced those actions in desktop Settings.
  - Control-panel Settings now uses those same draft approval endpoints, keeping Bug Monitor decisions consistent across desktop and web surfaces.
  - Added `POST /bug-monitor/drafts/{id}/triage-run`, which promotes an approved draft into a minimal engine-owned `bug_monitor_triage` context run with seeded inspection and validation tasks.
  - Desktop and control-panel Settings can now create those triage runs directly from approved Bug Monitor drafts.
  - Control-panel Dashboard now includes those `bug_monitor_triage` context runs in the existing context-run visibility drawer.
  - Added `POST /bug-monitor/drafts/{id}/issue-draft`, which renders a template-aware issue draft artifact from the repo bug template before GitHub publish.
  - Bug Monitor GitHub publish now uses that rendered issue-draft artifact instead of opening issues directly from raw incident details.
  - Auto-publish now defers with `triage_pending` until a triage-backed issue draft exists, preventing premature low-signal issue creation.
  - Fixed Bug Monitor incident persistence so draft-creation failures leave a visible incident error instead of a half-created tracker row.
  - Approving a Bug Monitor draft no longer fails the operator action just because the follow-up GitHub publish step is blocked.
  - Split Bug Monitor readiness into local ingest vs GitHub publish readiness so live tracker surfaces can show “watching locally” when incident capture is healthy but GitHub posting is blocked.
  - Added `POST /bug-monitor/drafts/{id}/triage-summary` so Bug Monitor triage can persist a structured summary artifact for issue drafting.
  - Bug Monitor issue-draft generation now prefers that structured triage summary over raw incident detail when rendering the repo issue template.
  - Bug Monitor now suppresses duplicate incidents earlier in both runtime ingest and manual `POST /bug-monitor/report` flows by consulting stored `failure_pattern` memory before opening a fresh draft.
  - Bug Monitor incidents now persist a compact duplicate summary when suppression happens so tracker UIs can explain duplicate suppression after reload/reconnect without overloading the raw source-event payload.
  - Bug Monitor triage summaries now persist governed `failure_pattern` memory for subject `bug_monitor`, so structured triage can suppress later matching reports even without a prior coder-run artifact.
  - Approving a Bug Monitor draft without triage now also persists governed `failure_pattern` memory from the approved draft itself, so operator-approved issues still teach duplicate suppression.
  - `failure_pattern` memory now carries recurrence metadata and stronger issue-linkage metadata, and duplicate ranking uses recurrence as a tie-breaker after exact fingerprint matches.
  - Duplicate-suppressed Bug Monitor incidents now persist a normalized `duplicate_summary` envelope with match count, best-match details, recurrence metadata, and linked-issue unions so tracker UIs can explain suppression deterministically after reload/reconnect.
  - Manual `POST /bug-monitor/report` suppression now returns that same normalized `duplicate_summary` envelope, and failure-pattern matching reuses the exact-fingerprint -> recurrence -> score ordering so the reported best match stays aligned with runtime suppression.
  - Bug Monitor failure-pattern reuse responses now attach the same normalized `duplicate_summary` envelope alongside any raw `duplicate_matches`, and coder-originated duplicate matches now emit a stable `match_reason` so exact-fingerprint priority survives through shared ranking and summary shaping.

- Initial Tandem Coder engine API foundation
  - Added the first engine-owned coder endpoints:
    - `GET /coder/status`
    - `GET /coder/projects`
    - `GET /coder/projects/{project_id}`
    - `GET /coder/projects/{project_id}/runs`
    - `POST /coder/projects/{project_id}/runs`
    - `GET /coder/projects/{project_id}/bindings`
    - `PUT /coder/projects/{project_id}/bindings`
    - `POST /coder/runs`
    - `GET /coder/runs`
    - `GET /coder/runs/{id}`
    - `GET /coder/runs/{id}/artifacts`
    - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/execute-next`
    - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/execute-all`
  - `GET /coder/status` now summarizes total runs, active/awaiting-approval counts, workflow distribution, run-status distribution, project count, and the latest coder run directly from engine-owned run state.
  - `GET /coder/projects` now summarizes known repo bindings, workflow coverage, latest run metadata, and project-level coder policy from existing engine-owned run state.
  - `GET /coder/projects/{project_id}` now returns project policy, explicit binding, and recent run state in one engine-backed payload.
  - `GET /coder/projects/{project_id}/runs` now returns project-scoped coder runs with execution policy and merge policy summaries already attached.
  - `POST /coder/projects/{project_id}/runs` now creates coder runs from a saved project binding and fails closed with `CODER_PROJECT_BINDING_REQUIRED` until that binding exists.
  - Shared coder memory retrieval is now explicit in the engine contract: run detail and `GET /coder/runs/{id}/memory-hits` now include `retrieval_policy`, and the underlying helper now combines repo candidates, project memory, and governed memory with workflow-specific ranking.
  - `issue_triage` retrieval now prioritizes `regression_signal` alongside `failure_pattern`, and promoted triage reproduction failures can now be reused across related issues through governed memory because regression-signal promotion accepts reproduction and validation evidence artifacts in addition to summary/review artifacts.
  - `issue_triage` can now infer duplicate pull-request candidates from historical `duplicate_linkage` memory and writes its own `duplicate_linkage` candidate when triage concludes an issue is already covered by linked PR history.
  - triage/fix retrieval now gives `duplicate_linkage` more weight, so cross-workflow issue↔PR history surfaces ahead of more generic triage memory when linked duplicates exist.
  - `pr_review` now reuses prior `merge_recommendation_memory` on the same PR, and `merge_recommendation` now reuses prior `review_memory` on the same PR, so adjacent workflow context is available through the shared retrieval layer instead of depending only on governed-memory fallback.
  - Real issue-fix PR submit now writes `duplicate_linkage` memory linking issue and pull-request numbers, returns that candidate in submit responses/events/artifacts, and makes it reusable in follow-on PR review retrieval.
  - Generic terminal coder transitions now backfill a reusable `run_outcome` candidate for failed and cancelled runs when no richer workflow-specific outcome already exists, and return that generated candidate directly from the transition response.
  - Bug Monitor triage summaries now also persist governed `regression_signal` memory alongside `failure_pattern`, with a matching context-run artifact and structured expected-behavior context for later post-failure reuse.
  - Explicit project bindings can now be stored independently of runs, and `/coder/projects` now prefers those saved bindings over derived run bindings when both exist.
  - Coder runs now persist as thin metadata records linked to engine context runs rather than introducing a frontend-owned workflow store.
  - Added structured intermediate and final artifacts for triage inspection/reproduction, issue-fix validation and patch evidence, PR review evidence, and merge readiness.
  - Added governed-memory-aware retrieval and reusable coder memory outputs across `issue_triage`, `issue_fix`, `pr_review`, and `merge_recommendation`.
  - Added engine-owned issue-fix PR drafting and approval-gated submit handoff through:
    - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-draft`
    - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-submit`
  - PR submit artifacts now preserve stable repo context plus a canonical `submitted_github_ref`, and GitHub/MCP result parsing now accepts minimal number-only PR result shapes so downstream review and merge flows have a stable PR handoff target.
  - Fixed PR submit MCP tool resolution so builtin raw tool names and runtime namespaced tool names both resolve correctly, and added real HTTP-backed regression coverage for non-dry-run PR submission.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/follow-on-run`, which can spawn `pr_review` or `merge_recommendation` runs directly from the canonical submitted PR ref on an issue-fix submit artifact.
  - PR submit artifacts now also include machine-readable `follow_on_runs` templates so later review/merge workflows can be chained from the engine-owned submission payload without reconstructing run inputs in the UI.
  - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-submit` now also returns `submitted_github_ref`, `pull_request`, and `follow_on_runs` directly in the response so clients do not need a second artifact read to continue the workflow.
  - `coder.pr.submitted` events now also include the canonical submitted PR ref, PR number, and follow-on workflow templates so streaming clients can continue the workflow without a follow-up fetch.
  - `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-submit` can now optionally auto-create follow-on `pr_review` and `merge_recommendation` runs through engine-owned chaining, returning those spawned runs directly in `spawned_follow_on_runs`.
  - Merge auto-follow-ons now require explicit `allow_auto_merge_recommendation` opt-in; otherwise submit auto-spawns review only, records the skipped merge follow-on with a deterministic reason, and emits that policy outcome in the submit response, artifact, and `coder.pr.submitted` event.
  - Spawned and manual follow-on coder runs now persist `parent_coder_run_id`, `origin`, and `origin_artifact_type`, so downstream review and merge runs can be traced back to the issue-fix PR submission that created them.
  - `pr_review` now uses the real coder worker-session bridge during `review_pull_request`, persists `coder_pr_review_worker_session`, and feeds parsed worker output into the existing review-evidence and final summary artifacts instead of fabricating review text inline.
  - `merge_recommendation` now uses the real coder worker-session bridge during `assess_merge_readiness`, persists `coder_merge_recommendation_worker_session`, and feeds parsed worker output into the existing readiness and final summary artifacts instead of hardcoded merge guidance.
  - `issue_triage` now uses the real coder worker-session bridge during repo inspection, persists `coder_issue_triage_worker_session`, and reuses parsed worker output for inspection, reproduction, and final summary artifacts instead of synthetic triage step payloads.
  - Follow-on review and merge runs now persist structured `origin_policy` metadata, so downstream runs know whether they were manual vs auto-spawned and whether merge auto-spawn had been explicitly opted in at submit time.
  - PR-submit `follow_on_runs` templates now carry the same parent/origin policy context that spawned review and merge runs use, so clients can preview engine chaining policy before creating any downstream runs.
  - Follow-on run `origin_policy` now consistently uses `merge_auto_spawn_opted_in` for both templates and spawned/manual runs, avoiding two names for the same merge auto-spawn decision.
  - Merge-recommendation follow-on runs created from PR submission are now execution-gated until a sibling `pr_review` run completes, so merge assessment cannot run ahead of review even when the follow-on run already exists.
  - PR-submit follow-on templates and merge follow-on run metadata now expose `required_completed_workflow_modes`, so clients can surface the review-before-merge prerequisite without inferring policy locally.
  - `GET /coder/runs` and `GET /coder/runs/{id}` now return engine-owned `execution_policy` summaries for coder runs, so clients can tell when a merge follow-on is blocked by review policy before attempting execution.
  - PR-submit handoff payloads now also expose follow-on `execution_policy_preview` metadata and live `execution_policy` on spawned follow-on runs, so clients can render review-before-merge gating directly from the submit response, artifact, and event payloads without an extra run fetch.
  - `POST /coder/runs` now also returns `execution_policy`, so manual follow-on creation responses are immediately truthful about blocked merge-recommendation runs without requiring a follow-up read.
  - Blocked `execute-next` / `execute-all` responses now also return `coder_run`, `run`, and `execution_policy`, so clients can stay in sync after a policy block without issuing a second fetch.
  - Blocked `execute-next` / `execute-all` now also emit `coder.run.phase_changed` with `event_type = execution_policy_blocked`, so streaming clients can react to follow-on policy blocks without polling.
  - Merge-recommendation summaries that come back `merge` with no remaining blockers/checks/approvals now stop in `awaiting_approval` and emit `coder.approval.required`, instead of looking fully completed before an operator approves the recommendation.
  - Approving a merge-ready recommendation through `POST /coder/runs/{id}/approve` now completes the run cleanly with `merge_recommendation_approved` instead of sending it back to `running`.
  - That approval step now also writes a `coder_merge_execution_request` artifact and emits `coder.merge.recommended`, giving the engine a concrete post-approval merge handoff before a real merge MCP path exists.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/merge-submit`, which reuses that handoff artifact, gates on `github.merge_pull_request`, persists `coder_merge_submission`, and can execute a real MCP-backed merge for approved merge recommendations.
  - `merge-submit` now also blocks on the handoff artifact itself, so it will not merge unless the latest `coder_merge_execution_request` still says `recommendation = merge` and has no remaining blockers, required checks, or required approvals.
  - `merge-submit` now defaults to `submit_mode = manual` and blocks `submit_mode = auto` unless the follow-on run's origin policy explicitly opted into auto merge execution, keeping merge execution manual-by-default even after recommendation approval.
  - `merge-submit` now also requires an approving sibling `pr_review` for issue-fix follow-on merge runs, so merge execution is blocked if the completed review still reports blockers or requested changes.
  - `merge-submit` now evaluates the latest completed sibling `pr_review`, so a newer review with requested changes overrides an older approval instead of whichever completed review is discovered first.
  - Merge-ready approval responses and `GET /coder/runs/{id}` for merge runs now expose a dynamic `merge_submit_policy` summary, so clients can see whether manual or auto merge-submit is currently blocked before attempting the merge call.
  - `coder_merge_execution_request` artifacts and `coder.merge.recommended` events now also carry a `merge_submit_policy_preview`, so streaming and artifact-driven clients receive the same merge-submit policy context without a follow-up read.
  - `merge-submit` now also requires the merge run itself to be an auto-spawned follow-on before `submit_mode = auto` is eligible, so a manual follow-on merge run cannot escalate into auto merge execution even if the parent PR submit opted into auto merge recommendation.
  - `merge_submit_policy` summaries now also include `preferred_submit_mode`, so clients and future automation can consume an engine-owned recommendation instead of inferring manual-vs-auto behavior from blocked flags alone.
  - `merge_submit_policy` summaries now also make the current execution contract explicit with `explicit_submit_required = true` and `auto_execute_after_approval = false`, so clients know approval alone never auto-merges today.
  - `merge_submit_policy` summaries now also include `auto_execute_eligible` and `auto_execute_block_reason`, so clients can distinguish “auto is preferred later” from “auto can run now” without reverse-engineering that from other flags.
  - Added `GET /coder/projects/{project_id}/policy` and `PUT /coder/projects/{project_id}/policy`, with a default-off project-level `auto_merge_enabled` switch that now feeds `merge_submit_policy.auto_execute_policy_enabled` and changes merge-ready auto-execution blocking to `project_auto_merge_policy_disabled` until a project explicitly opts in.
  - `merge_submit_policy.auto_execute_eligible` now becomes `true` when a merge run is auto-spawned, review-approved, merge-ready, and the project-level `auto_merge_enabled` switch is on, while still keeping `explicit_submit_required = true` and `auto_execute_after_approval = false` so the engine reports readiness truthfully without auto-merging yet.
  - `POST /coder/runs` now also returns `merge_submit_policy` for merge-recommendation runs, so manual and spawned merge follow-on creation responses surface project auto-merge policy and merge-submit prerequisites immediately instead of forcing a follow-up run read.
  - `merge_submit_policy.auto_execute_block_reason` now reports the earliest real blocker (`requires_merge_execution_request`, `requires_completed_pr_review_follow_on`, `requires_approved_pr_review_follow_on`, etc.) instead of collapsing those states back to a generic `preferred_submit_mode_manual`.
  - PR-submit `follow_on_runs` templates now also carry `merge_submit_policy_preview` for merge follow-ons, so clients can see project auto-merge policy and merge-submit prerequisites before the merge run even exists.
  - Merge-ready `coder.approval.required` events and `merge-recommendation-summary` responses now also carry `merge_submit_policy`, so streaming clients can see merge-submit readiness and project auto-merge policy without fetching the run.
  - Auto-follow-on merge chaining now normalizes through review first, so requesting `merge_recommendation` auto-spawn implicitly schedules `pr_review` ahead of merge instead of trusting the client to order those runs correctly.
  - `issue_triage` coder run creation now seeds a deterministic context-run task template for issue normalization, memory retrieval, repo inspection, reproduction, and triage artifact writing.
  - Added initial `coder.run.created` engine event emission and backend regression coverage for coder create/get/list/artifact behavior.
  - `issue_triage` now has a first real worker bridge: `execute-next` claims the next runnable context task through the shared lease/claim runtime and dispatches deterministic inspection, reproduction, and final summary actions so the run can complete end to end without frontend-owned orchestration.
  - `issue_fix` now uses that same `execute-next` worker bridge: the engine claims fix tasks through the shared task runtime, advances inspection and preparation nodes through workflow progression, and dispatches validation plus final summary handlers to complete the run end to end.
  - `pr_review` now also uses `execute-next`: the engine claims review tasks through the same task runtime, advances the initial inspection node through workflow progression, and dispatches review-evidence plus final summary handlers to complete the run end to end.
  - `merge_recommendation` now uses `execute-next` too: the engine claims merge-readiness tasks through the same task runtime, advances the initial inspection node through workflow progression, and dispatches readiness plus final recommendation handlers to complete the run end to end.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/execute-all`, which loops that same engine-owned task runtime until a coder run completes, fails, cancels, exhausts runnable tasks, or hits a configured step cap.
  - Added an initial fail-closed readiness gate for `issue_triage`: required GitHub issue capability bindings must exist, and any explicitly requested MCP servers must be configured and connected.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/memory-candidates` so `issue_triage` runs can persist engine-owned memory candidate payloads and attach them to the linked context run as `coder_memory_candidate` artifacts.
  - New `issue_triage` runs now seed their retrieval task with prior repo/issue memory candidate hints from earlier coder runs.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/triage-summary` so the engine can write a concrete `triage.summary.json` artifact and attach it as `coder_triage_summary`.
  - Added `GET /coder/runs/{id}/memory-hits` so clients can inspect ranked triage retrieval hits for the current coder run.
  - `issue_triage` bootstrap now combines prior `coder_memory_candidate` payloads with project semantic memory search and writes a `coder_memory_hits` artifact into the linked context run.
  - Triage summary writes now auto-generate reusable `triage_memory` and `run_outcome` memory candidates so later coder runs can reuse structured triage conclusions without a separate manual candidate write.
  - `issue_triage` memory retrieval now also ranks governed/shared memory hits from the existing engine memory database alongside project semantic memory and prior coder-local candidates.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/memory-candidates/{candidate_id}/promote` so reviewed coder memory candidates can be stored in governed memory and optionally promoted to shared visibility with reviewer metadata.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/approve` and `POST /coder/runs/{id}/cancel` as thin coder control endpoints over the existing context-run transition model.
  - Those control endpoints now emit `coder.run.phase_changed`, and cancelled coder runs now project a dedicated `cancelled` phase.
  - `issue_triage` readiness now reuses the shared engine capability-readiness evaluator, so coder run creation blocks on the same missing/unbound/disconnected/auth-pending conditions surfaced by `/capabilities/readiness`.
  - Explicit `mcp_servers` requested by coder runs still remain hard requirements on top of that shared readiness check.
  - Coder memory promotion now reuses the generic governed-memory `memory_put` / `memory_promote` path instead of a coder-specific direct DB bridge.
  - Run-scoped governed-memory capability issuance is now shared through `skills_memory.rs` helpers, so coder workflows derive subject and tier policy through the same helper path as the generic memory routes.
  - Fixed cold-start global memory initialization so `/memory/*` routes create the memory DB parent directory before opening SQLite.
  - Coder lifecycle and artifact events now share a normalized payload shape, and `coder.artifact.added` includes explicit `kind` metadata so desktop and other clients can consume coder events without per-event special casing.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-review-summary` so `pr_review` runs can write a structured `coder_pr_review_summary` artifact and emit a first `run_outcome` memory candidate.
  - Added the first `pr_review` coder workflow skeleton with GitHub PR readiness checks, seeded review task graphs, and direct MCP GitHub pull-request capability bindings.
  - `pr_review` now defaults to pull-request-specific memory queries, bootstraps a `coder_memory_hits` artifact at run creation, and reuses prior review `run_outcome` memory during later reviews of the same repo/PR.
  - `pr_review` summary writes now also emit reusable `review_memory` candidates, and follow-on PR reviews can retrieve that review-specific memory through the shared coder memory-hits path.
  - `pr_review` summary writes now also emit `regression_signal` candidates when review input includes historical regression signals, and later PR reviews can retrieve those signals through the same repo/PR memory-hits path.
  - Added the first `merge_recommendation` coder workflow skeleton with PR-backed readiness checks, seeded merge-assessment tasks, bootstrapped `coder_memory_hits`, and `POST /coder/runs/{id}/merge-recommendation-summary` for structured merge recommendation artifacts.
  - Merge recommendation summaries now emit reusable `merge_recommendation_memory` and `run_outcome` candidates so later runs can reuse prior merge guidance without needing a separate manual candidate write.
  - Added a dedicated `merge_recommendation_memory` candidate kind so merge guidance is stored as reusable recommendation knowledge instead of only a generic run outcome.
  - Added the first `issue_fix` coder workflow skeleton with issue-backed readiness checks, seeded fix and validation tasks, bootstrapped `coder_memory_hits`, and `POST /coder/runs/{id}/issue-fix-summary` for structured fix summary artifacts that emit reusable `run_outcome` memory.
  - `issue_fix` summary writes now also emit reusable `fix_pattern` memory so later fix runs can reuse prior patch strategies and validation context.
  - `issue_fix` memory retrieval now ranks same-issue `fix_pattern` and issue-fix `run_outcome` hits ahead of generic triage memory so fix runs surface prior patch strategy first.
  - `merge_recommendation` memory retrieval now ranks same-PR `merge_recommendation_memory`, merge run outcomes, and regression signals ahead of generic review memory so merge runs surface prior merge guidance first.
  - `merge_recommendation` ranking now also prefers policy-rich same-PR memories that carry blockers, required checks, or required approvals over generic merge summaries, so readiness-specific history surfaces first.
  - `pr_review` memory retrieval now ranks same-PR `review_memory`, `regression_signal`, and PR review outcomes ahead of generic triage memory so review runs surface prior review guidance first.
  - `pr_review` ranking now also prefers richer same-PR review memories that carry blockers, requested changes, or regression signals over generic review summaries, so actionable review history surfaces first.
  - `issue_triage` memory retrieval now ranks same-issue `failure_pattern`, triage-memory, and triage run outcomes ahead of generic hits so duplicate/root-cause history surfaces first during new triage runs.
  - `issue_fix` summary writes now also emit a dedicated `coder_validation_report` artifact when validation steps or results are provided, so validation evidence is consumable without parsing the fix summary.
  - `issue_fix` summary writes now also emit reusable `validation_memory` candidates, and same-issue fix retrieval ranks that validation-specific memory ahead of generic triage memory so later fix runs can reuse prior validation evidence directly.
  - `issue_fix` now uses a real coder-owned worker session during `prepare_fix`: the engine resolves a worker model, creates a scoped repo session, runs a real prompt through `run_prompt_async_with_context`, and persists the transcript as a `coder_issue_fix_worker_session` artifact before validation continues.
  - `prepare_fix` now also derives a deterministic `coder_issue_fix_plan` artifact from that worker transcript so later validation and summary steps have a stable, engine-owned fix-plan record to consume.
  - `validate_fix` now also launches a real coder-owned validation session and persists a `coder_issue_fix_validation_session` artifact, so validation evidence comes from the same engine session/runtime path instead of a synthetic placeholder step.
  - `prepare_fix` now also harvests concrete changed-file evidence from worker tool invocations and persists it as `coder_changed_file_evidence`, giving later fix validation and UI surfaces an engine-owned record of touched paths when the worker actually edits files.
  - Changed-file evidence now captures per-file tool provenance plus short content previews when worker tool args include editable payloads, and final `coder_patch_summary` artifacts now carry those harvested entries forward for downstream review surfaces.
  - `issue_fix` patch evidence now also snapshots the touched workspace files from the engine side, attaching lightweight file-existence, size, line-count, and preview metadata to both `coder_changed_file_evidence` and `coder_patch_summary`.
  - Final issue-fix summaries now also emit a dedicated `coder_patch_summary` artifact that ties the structured fix summary to changed files plus the linked worker and validation session IDs, giving desktop and future UIs a stable engine-owned patch-summary surface before full diff harvesting is added.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-draft` for `issue_fix`, which builds an engine-owned `coder_pr_draft` artifact from the latest fix summary, validation, and patch evidence and emits `coder.approval.required` for human review before submission.
  - Added `POST /coder/runs/{id}/pr-submit`, which reuses that `coder_pr_draft`, enforces fail-closed `github.create_pull_request` readiness, and writes a `coder_pr_submission` artifact for dry-run or approved submission flows.
  - `issue_fix` validation and final summary generation now reuse those worker-session, validation-session, and issue-fix-plan artifacts, attaching session IDs, transcript excerpts, and plan-derived fields instead of only generic inline placeholders.
  - Fixed a small set of ownership bugs in `skills_memory.rs` that were blocking `tandem-server` validation for the shared governed-memory path used by coder promotion and worker-backed issue-fix execution.
  - `issue_triage` memory retrieval now ranks same-issue `failure_pattern`, `triage_memory`, and issue-triage `run_outcome` hits above generic project/governed matches so triage runs surface prior failure signatures and conclusions first.
  - Repo-scoped coder memory retrieval is now GitHub-ref-aware, so `pr_review` and `merge_recommendation` get a true same-PR boost instead of only issue-number or recency bias.
  - Promoted coder memory now stores richer searchable governed-memory content from workflow payloads, including fix strategy, root cause, blockers, required checks, approvals, validation details, and regression summaries instead of only a bare summary string.
  - Merge recommendation summaries now also write a dedicated `coder_merge_readiness_report` artifact whenever blockers, required checks, or required approvals are present, so merge readiness state is directly consumable without reparsing the summary artifact.

## v0.4.1 (2026-03-07)

- Strict swarm write reliability and cross-client engine retries
  - Fixed streamed OpenAI/OpenRouter tool-call parsing so multi-chunk `write` args keep the correct tool-call identity and no longer lose later argument chunks when the provider omits the tool name on follow-up deltas.
  - Hardened write-argument recovery for truncated/malformed JSON: the engine can now recover `content` even when `path` is missing, and the default provider output budget was raised from `2048` to `16384` so large single-file artifacts are less likely to be clipped.
  - Session/tool history persistence now preserves write args/results through the verifier path, avoiding false `NO_TOOL_ACTIVITY_NO_WORKSPACE_CHANGE` / strict-write failure classifications when tools actually ran.
  - Swarm planner/worker prompts now favor one implementation task for single-file goals, reducing over-decomposition on greenfield artifact generation.
  - Added consistent local-engine retry handling for transient transport failures and `ENGINE_STARTING` responses across the control-panel orchestrator, Tauri desktop sidecar client, and Rust TUI client.

- Provider catalog honesty in Settings and `/provider`
  - `GET /provider` now returns explicit catalog metadata so clients can distinguish live remote model catalogs from config-defined catalogs and manual-entry-only providers.
  - Removed the synthetic single-model fallback behavior that made most non-OpenRouter providers appear to have exactly one available model.
  - Live remote model discovery is now attempted for supported providers (`openrouter`, `openai`, `groq`, `mistral`, `together`), while unsupported/non-generic providers stay configurable through manual model entry.
  - Control-panel Settings now renders provider rows more honestly:
    - real counts for remote catalogs
    - `configured models` for config-defined catalogs
    - `manual entry` when live discovery is unavailable

- Headless-first Chromium browser automation with readiness diagnostics
  - Added a new `tandem-browser` sidecar for local Chromium automation over stdio, with typed browser actions for open, navigate, snapshot, click, type, press, wait, extract, screenshot, and close.
  - Browser automation is now explicitly headless-first: it works on a VPS with no GUI as long as the sidecar and a Chromium-based browser are installed on the same host as `tandem-engine`.
  - Added readiness diagnostics that do real browser launch smoke tests, detect missing Chrome/Chromium/Edge/Brave installs, surface Linux install hints, and explain non-runnable states instead of silently omitting browser capability.
  - Added engine-managed sidecar install/distribution:
    - `tandem-engine browser install`
    - `POST /browser/install`
    - managed sidecar discovery from Tandem shared `binaries/` storage so standard installs do not need `TANDEM_BROWSER_SIDECAR`
    - standalone `tandem-browser-*` assets in the release workflows
  - Added operator/browser status surfaces across the stack:
    - `GET /browser/status`
    - browser summary on `GET /global/health`
    - `tandem-engine browser status`
    - `tandem-engine browser doctor`
    - `POST /browser/smoke-test`
    - `tandem-browser doctor --json`
    - TUI `/browser status` and `/browser doctor`
    - control-panel Browser Diagnostics card in Settings with sidecar install and smoke-test actions
  - Replaced the generic model-facing browser action shape with typed engine tools:
    - `browser_status`
    - `browser_open`
    - `browser_navigate`
    - `browser_snapshot`
    - `browser_click`
    - `browser_type`
    - `browser_press`
    - `browser_wait`
    - `browser_extract`
    - `browser_screenshot`
    - `browser_close`
  - Browser tool registration now works in both server and one-shot runtime paths, and `browser_status` remains available even when full browser execution is blocked.
  - Screenshots and oversized extracts now persist as artifacts/files rather than being returned as large inline base64 payloads.
  - Session cancel, global dispose, stale-run reaping, and routine-pause flows now clean up tracked browser sessions to avoid leaked headless browser state.
  - Added an engine-owned smoke test that opens `https://example.com`, snapshots it, extracts visible text, and closes the browser session so operators can validate the full runtime path from the control panel or direct API calls.
  - Sidecar stdio failures now preserve sidecar stderr and retry once after an unexpected disconnect before returning an error.

- Orchestrator multi-run fan-in + run workspace parity
  - tandem-engine now provides multiplex orchestration event fan-in at `GET /context/runs/events/stream` so one SSE connection can track multiple run IDs concurrently.
  - stream cursor decode/encode support was added so reconnects can resume from the last acknowledged event window.
  - control panel now exposes `/api/orchestrator/events` backed by multiplex stream proxying with legacy fallback logic for older engine behavior.
  - added `/api/orchestrator/events/health` to quickly verify orchestrator streaming status and fallback mode.
  - control panel orchestration state now tracks a run registry (active + historical runs) instead of single-run replacement.
  - added a dedicated Orchestrator workspace view with run selection and start-state behavior aligned to desktop orchestration UX.
  - orchestration and chat history UI now use a consistent history icon style for session/run lists.

- Blackboard as central coordination layer + control panel parity
  - Engine blackboard now includes first-class task coordination state (`blackboard.tasks`) with workflow references, task lineage fields, lease metadata, retries, and optimistic task revision (`task_rev`).
  - Added append-only task patch operations:
    - `add_task`
    - `update_task_lease`
    - `update_task_state`
  - Added task lifecycle endpoints:
    - `POST /context/runs/{run_id}/tasks`
    - `POST /context/runs/{run_id}/tasks/claim`
    - `POST /context/runs/{run_id}/tasks/{task_id}/transition`
    - `GET /context/runs/{run_id}/blackboard/patches`
  - Added task lifecycle event emission on context runs (`context.task.created/claimed/started/completed/failed/...`) carrying `patch_seq` + `task_rev` for deterministic UI refresh.
  - Added optional `context_run_id` support on `/pack-builder/preview`, `/pack-builder/apply`, `/pack-builder/cancel`, and `/pack-builder/pending`; when provided, pack-builder lifecycle is mirrored into blackboard task state/events for that context run.
  - `automation_v2_dag` node status now projects into context blackboard tasks; `GET /automations/v2/runs/{run_id}` now includes `contextRunID` for that projection.
  - Added optional `context_run_id` on `/skills/router/match` and `/skills/compile`; skill routing/compile outputs now emit blackboard task records for workflow coordination.
  - Desktop convergence: Tauri `orchestrator_get_blackboard` and `orchestrator_get_blackboard_patches` now read engine context-run blackboard/patch streams first, with local orchestrator storage as temporary fallback.
  - Additional desktop convergence: legacy read commands (`orchestrator_get_events`, `orchestrator_list_runs`, `orchestrator_load_run`) now use engine context-run APIs first, with local fallback only for legacy run data.
  - Added compatibility guard for legacy persisted blackboards that predate `tasks`; engine now loads them with safe defaults.
  - Control panel SSE parity: `/api/swarm/events` now emits incremental `blackboard_patch` events alongside run events so blackboard-only updates refresh live.
  - Swarm task board UI hardening: very long task/prompt titles now clamp and wrap by default with `More/Less` expansion, preventing layout blowout.
  - Replay now includes blackboard parity checks for task revision/count/status and returns replayed/persisted blackboard payloads for drift diagnostics.
  - Control panel swarm shim now forwards blackboard patch streams, and `SwarmPage` now supports blackboard docked, expanded, and fullscreen debug views with decision lineage, agent lanes, workflow progress, artifact lineage, and drift indicators.
  - Added contract/regression tests for claim races, command-id idempotency, optimistic revision mismatch, monotonic patch sequence, and replay parity.
  - Fixed Swarm Continue/Resume no-op path in control panel executor:
    - if driver returns no `selected_step_id` because a step is already `in_progress`, executor now resumes that step instead of exiting
    - continue/resume API responses now include execution diagnostics (`started`, `requeued`, `selectedStepId`, `whyNextStep`)
    - Swarm page now surfaces `lastError` to make provider/session failures visible without inspecting server logs
    - execution sessions now fall back to configured swarm provider/model when older runs do not have provider/model fields populated
  - Added swarm fail-closed model resolution and dispatch guards:
    - execution model resolution now follows `run model -> swarm state model -> engine default provider/model` and fails fast if unresolved
    - `prompt_sync` empty/no-op responses now fail the step with explicit diagnostics instead of reporting false completion
    - loop guard stops repeated same-step execution when step state does not advance after completion (`STEP_STATE_NOT_ADVANCING`)
    - compatibility reconcile path now marks stale completed steps as `done` via engine API when run-state transitions lag, and emits `step_completion_reconciled`
    - `/api/swarm/status` now returns resolved model + executor state/reason for faster diagnosis
  - Added run list cleanup controls in control panel:
    - per-run `Hide` action and bulk `Hide Completed` action in Swarm view
    - hidden runs are user-scoped and persisted locally (`~/.tandem/control-panel/swarm-hidden-runs.json`)
    - hidden runs are filtered from `/api/swarm/runs` by default without deleting engine run data
  - Fixed completed-run false error UI state and added explicit output visibility:
    - normal completion no longer sets swarm `lastError` to `all steps are done; marking run completed`
    - Swarm now shows a `Run Output` panel with latest completed step, session ID, and assistant output preview
    - task `Open Session` links now resolve from step completion events (`session_id`) for reliable output access
    - status badges now use semantic colors for done/completed, failed, and in-progress states
  - Increased duplicate-signature retry headroom for write/edit loops:
    - `write`/`edit`/`multi_edit`/`apply_patch` duplicate call signature limit now defaults to `200` (was `3`)
    - `pack_builder` remains strict at `1`; shell tools remain strict at `2`
    - global override `TANDEM_TOOL_LOOP_DUPLICATE_SIGNATURE_LIMIT` remains supported
- Automation creation UX — simplified to "just describe what you want"
  - Replaced the fragmented `Agents`, `Packs`, and `Teams` pages with a single **Automations** hub (`AutomationsPage`).
  - New **4-step creation wizard**: describe your goal in plain English → pick a recurring schedule → choose how agents run → review & deploy. No YAML, no route navigation between pages.
  - **Execution mode selector** surfaces the orchestration options most users never found before: `Single Agent`, `Agent Team` (recommended), or `Swarm`. Agent Team is now the default — you get an orchestrated multi-agent run out of the box.
  - **My Automations** tab combines installed packs, scheduled routines, and recent run history in one scrollable view.
  - **Teams & Approvals** tab shows active agent-team instances and pending spawn approvals so operators can approve/deny without leaving the page.
  - Legacy deep-links (`#/agents`, `#/packs`, `#/teams`) all redirect to `/automations` — existing bookmarks keep working.
  - Primary sidebar trimmed from 12 items to 7: Dashboard, Chat, Automations, Swarm, Memory, Live Feed, Settings.

- Pack Builder orchestration/swarm execution modes
  - `pack_builder` tool now accepts `execution_mode` (`single` | `team` | `swarm`) and `max_agents` fields.
  - Generated routine YAML now includes an `args.orchestration` block so the runtime knows to dispatch to an agent team or parallel swarm instead of a single loop.
  - Default changed to `team` — new packs created via chat now schedule against an orchestrated agent team by default.

- Pack Builder zip storage race condition fixed
  - Generated pack zip artifacts are now written to a persistent directory (`~/.tandem/data/pack_builder_zips/` or `TANDEM_STATE_DIR/pack_builder_zips/`) instead of the OS temp directory.
  - This closes a silent failure mode where OS-level temp cleanup between the `preview` and `apply` steps caused `preview_artifacts_missing` errors, making pack creation via chat unreliable in practice.
  - Old staging directories for evicted plan IDs are now cleaned up automatically.

## v0.4.0 (2026-03-03)

- Pack Builder MCP-first automation flow (`v0.4.1` scope)
  - Added built-in `pack_builder` tool with `preview` and `apply` modes for creating Tandem packs from plain-English goals.
  - External capabilities are now connector-first: builder maps to MCP catalog servers by default and only falls back to built-ins when no match exists (with warnings).
  - Generated mission/agent artifacts now include explicit `mcp.*` tool IDs so routines invoke registered connectors directly.
  - Preview now returns connector candidates (docs/transport/auth/setup), selected MCP mapping, required secrets, and explicit approval requirements.
  - Apply now enforces user approvals for connector registration and pack install; routines are registered paused by default unless explicitly enabled.
  - Added persisted `pack_presets` metadata with registered MCP servers and required credentials for reliable preset reloads.
  - Added channel intent routing to automatically dispatch pack-creation requests to the `pack_builder` agent.
  - Added MCP-focused regression tests across server HTTP, preset registry, and channel routing.
  - Fixed engine boot race where pre-ready background tasks could panic with `runtime accessed before startup completion`; startup loops now gate on runtime readiness.
  - `pack_builder` is now baseline-allowed in engine permission defaults so first-run pack creation from chat/channels does not timeout on tool approval prompts.
  - Added runtime loop guardrails for `pack_builder` to reduce token waste on repeated identical tool calls (terminal follow-up behavior + duplicate-signature limit `1`).

- Semantic tool retrieval for MCP-heavy toolsets (`v0.4.1` scope)
  - Added embedding-backed semantic tool retrieval in `ToolRegistry` so the engine can send a relevant top-K tool subset instead of all schemas every turn.
  - Added startup bulk indexing (`tools.index_all`) plus incremental indexing on runtime tool registration (`register_tool`) so MCP servers connected after startup are indexed immediately.
  - Added index cleanup on `unregister_tool` and `unregister_by_prefix` so MCP disconnect/refresh does not leave stale vectors.
  - Engine loop now uses semantic retrieval by default (`TANDEM_SEMANTIC_TOOL_RETRIEVAL=1`) with `TANDEM_SEMANTIC_TOOL_RETRIEVAL_K` default `24` (aligned with existing expanded tool cap behavior).
  - Explicit allowlist/policy matches are unioned from the full tool list to prevent required tools from being dropped by top-K retrieval.
  - Runtime system prompt now includes a compact connected-integrations catalog (MCP server names only), gated by `TANDEM_MCP_CATALOG_IN_SYSTEM_PROMPT`.
  - Graceful fallback remains intact: when embeddings are unavailable/disabled, retrieval falls back to full tool listing.
  - Reliability hardening:
    - action-heavy prompts now trigger automatic fallback to full tool list when semantic top-K omits required web/email tool families
    - non-offered tool calls are rejected with available-tool hints instead of silently executing guessed names
    - assistant cannot claim email delivery succeeded unless a successful email-like tool action was executed in the run

- Pack Builder autonomous routines + routine-run connect reliability (`v0.4.1` scope)
  - Pack Builder apply now defaults to autonomous execution for unattended automation:
    - generated routines are enabled by default (`status=active`)
    - generated routines default to `requires_approval=false`
    - pack-builder apply API defaults approval flags to `true` unless explicitly overridden
  - Generated routine YAML from pack-builder now reflects no-approval default.
  - Increased default provider stream connect timeout from `30000` to `90000` ms to reduce routine runs failing before the model begins streaming.
  - Updated env/setup defaults accordingly:
    - `.env.example`
    - `examples/vps-web-portal/engine.env.example`
    - quickstart/VPS setup scripts

- Routine builder MCP tool selection UX (`v0.4.1` scope)
  - The routine editor now includes an MCP tool picker so users can search discovered MCP tools and add them directly to the routine allowlist.
  - Added connected-server filtering to quickly scope tool selection to a specific MCP integration.
  - Prevents fragile manual typing of long `mcp.*` tool IDs in routines.

- MCP catalog moved into engine and exposed to frontends
  - Added engine-managed embedded catalog endpoints:
    - `GET /mcp/catalog`
    - `GET /mcp/catalog/{slug}/toml`
  - Added generated catalog assets under `crates/tandem-server/resources/mcp-catalog` (index + per-server TOML manifests).
  - Added catalog generator tooling at `scripts/generate-mcp-catalog.mjs` plus control-panel refresh script `npm run mcp:catalog:refresh`.
  - Catalog now includes curated official remote MCP entries for:
    - GitHub: `https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/`
    - Jira (Atlassian): `https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp`
    - Notion: `https://mcp.notion.com/mcp`
  - Default curated GitHub pack no longer assumes Docker; it points to the official remote endpoint.

- MCP capability readiness preflight (fail-closed)
  - Added `POST /capabilities/readiness` for pre-run validation of required capability IDs.
  - Readiness output now reports blocking issues for:
    - missing capability bindings
    - unbound required capabilities
    - missing/disconnected required MCP servers
    - auth-pending MCP tools
  - Added SDK/UI surface parity:
    - TypeScript SDK: `client.capabilities.readiness(...)`
    - Tauri command and frontend wrapper: `capability_readiness` / `capabilityReadiness(...)`
    - Control-panel MCP and Pack builder flows now call readiness before key save/run paths.

- Control panel MCP UX now includes searchable remote pack catalog
  - MCP settings page now displays searchable “Remote MCP Packs” sourced from engine catalog.
  - Added quick actions to apply pack transport/name and open generated TOML.
  - Added MCP-side readiness check UI with structured result rendering.

- Desktop (Tauri) MCP UX now includes searchable remote catalog
  - Added Tauri-side `mcp_catalog` command/wrapper to consume engine `GET /mcp/catalog`.
  - Extensions -> Integrations now includes searchable “Remote MCP catalog” list.
  - Added “Apply” action to prefill remote server name/URL and “Docs” quick-open links.

- Engine provider auth persistence + status API overhaul
  - Provider keys set via `PUT /auth/{provider}` are now durable across engine restarts.
  - Added engine-wide provider auth persistence in `tandem-core` with keychain-first storage and secure file fallback.
  - Engine startup now restores persisted provider keys into runtime provider config before provider registry init.
  - `GET /provider/auth` now returns real per-provider status including `has_key`, `configured`, `connected`, and `source`.
  - `DELETE /auth/{provider}` now removes both runtime and persisted provider auth state.

- Web control panel provider onboarding reliability
  - Provider readiness now enforces key presence for providers that require API keys (non-local providers).
  - Settings “Test Model Run” now pins explicit provider/model and blocks early when key prerequisites are missing.
  - Custom provider IDs are normalized consistently during save/test/delete key flows.
  - Reduced false “No stored key detected” states by consuming the real `/provider/auth` status response.
  - Replaced browser-native delete confirms with themed in-app confirmation modals for session, file, and pack deletion actions.
  - Moved toast notifications to the top-center anchor for better visibility across wide layouts.
  - Grouped Automations tabs and tab content inside one shared panel container for a cleaner, consistent layout.

    - editing creates project-local fork/override
    - tracking-fork update/diff semantics with scope-increase re-approval gate
  - Added shared PackManager + PresetRegistry API contracts designed for both frontends:
    - Tandem Desktop (Tauri)
    - `packages/tandem-control-panel`
  - Added explicit chat attachment ingestion contract for pack detection/install cards (`tandempack.yaml` marker-driven).

- Preset registry runtime/API foundation (first tranche)
  - Added layered preset indexing in server runtime across:
    - built-ins
    - installed packs
    - project overrides

    - `skill_modules`
    - `agent_presets`
    - `automation_presets`

  - Added deterministic prompt composition endpoint:
    - `POST /presets/compose/preview`
    - enforces deterministic ordering (`core` -> `domain` -> `style` -> `safety`)
    - returns stable `composition_hash` and ordered fragment IDs for testability
  - Added immutable-source fork/edit/save APIs for project overrides:
    - `POST /presets/fork` (fork from builtin/pack/runtime path into overrides)
    - `PUT /presets/overrides/{kind}/{id}` (save editable override)

    - `GET /packs/{selector}/updates` (stub)
    - `POST /packs/{selector}/update` (stub)
  - Added zip root-marker detection for pack eligibility (`tandempack.yaml` at archive root only).
  - Added install safety controls for zip extraction:
    - path traversal rejection
    - max file count/size/depth enforcement
    - max extracted bytes guardrail
    - entry/archive compression-ratio guardrails to reduce zip-bomb risk
  - Added deterministic pack install/index layout under `TANDEM_HOME/packs` with atomic index updates.
  - Added per-pack install/uninstall locking (by pack name) while preserving atomic index writes.
  - Added install lifecycle event emission for UI progress/status:
    - `pack.detected`
    - `pack.install.started`
    - `pack.install.succeeded`
    - `pack.install.failed`
    - `registry.updated`
  - Added/expanded pack route regression coverage:

    - strict reject mode enabled with `TANDEM_PACK_SECRET_SCAN_STRICT=1`
  - Update check/apply stubs now return structured `permissions_diff` and `reapproval_required` flags for future permission re-approval workflows.

- Capability Resolver runtime/API implementation (first tranche)
  - Added capability endpoints:
    - `GET /capabilities/bindings`
    - `PUT /capabilities/bindings`
    - `GET /capabilities/discovery`
    - `POST /capabilities/resolve`
  - Added data-driven capability bindings storage at:
    - `TANDEM_HOME/packs/bindings/capability_bindings.json`
  - Added runtime discovery of available tools from:
    - MCP `list_tools()` namespaced catalog
    - local tool registry schemas
  - Added provider preference-based resolution with MVP default priority:
    - `composio` -> `arcade` -> `mcp` -> `custom`
  - Added alias-aware tool-name matching in resolver:
    - supports separator/casing variation via normalized matching
    - supports explicit per-binding `tool_name_aliases`
  - Expanded curated capability spine defaults for GitHub + Slack bindings across Composio/Arcade/MCP/custom without introducing full-catalog mapping.
  - Added structured resolver conflict payload (`missing_capability`) for unresolved required capabilities.
  - Added resolver test coverage for explicit provider preference selection when both Composio and Arcade tool mappings are present.

    - provider-specific dependency count
    - routines declared/enabled summary
  - Pack update actions now surface `reapproval_required` warnings when update permission scope expands.
  - Added Skill Module Library in the Packs view:

    - filters: text/id/tag/layer, publisher, required capability
  - Added Agent Preset Builder in the Packs view:
    - source preset selection + fork action
    - deterministic prompt preview (`/presets/compose/preview`)

    - added settings tabs for these surfaces under a unified `Settings` view (`General`, `Packs`, `Channels`, `MCP`, `Files`)
    - added migration prompts in Automations and legacy pages to route users to Settings

- Control Panel pack event cards + actions
  - Added `pack.*` event-specific cards in `Live Feed` with direct actions:
    - open Pack Library
    - install from detected path
    - install from attachment metadata (`attachment_id` + `path`)
  - Added `Pack Events` rail in Chat with the same one-click actions so pack detection/install can be handled without leaving chat context.

- Control panel packs compatibility fix
  - Fixed `Packs` view failures on environments where `state.client.packs` or `state.client.capabilities` namespaces are not present by adding direct `/api/engine/*` fallback calls for list/inspect/install/uninstall/export/update/discovery.
- Settings tab visual polish
  - Reworked Settings section switching UI from generic buttons to dedicated tab styling for stronger active-state clarity and cleaner presentation.
  - Kept Settings content grouped under one parent Settings card and fixed missing tab icon rendering by registering required Lucide icons (`package`, `sliders-horizontal`).
  - Added an Appearance section in Settings with a shared theme selector backed by `tandem.themeId`, and applied desktop-style color/font tokens at control-panel boot for tighter desktop parity.
  - Updated control-panel shell styles (cards, nav, buttons, inputs, tabs) to consume theme tokens for cleaner first paint and more consistent transitions across route/tab changes.
  - Replaced plain loading copy with themed skeleton placeholders and tokenized sidebar/brand surfaces for a more polished first impression during route changes.
  - Expanded registered Lucide icon set used in packs/preset/settings surfaces to avoid missing icons during rerenders (`archive`, `copy-plus`, `sparkles`, `shield-check`, `arrow-up-circle`, `badge-check`, `binary`, `list`, `pencil`).
  - Fixed Settings tab icon disappearance on section switches by rehydrating icons at full Settings view scope (not only inner subview scope).
  - Updated Chat surface styling to shared theme tokens (removed hardcoded `zinc/slate` color islands in chat rails/messages/composer and dynamic chat cards), so changing theme in Settings now applies across chat UI as expected.
  - Improved Porcelain light-theme readability by darkening text/border token values and applying markdown light-mode contrast overrides for clearer chat and formatted content.
  - Updated Automations page theme fidelity:
    - wrapped automations UI in a scoped theme surface
    - remapped residual `slate/zinc` utility classes to shared tokens
    - converted automations tab chips and wizard step chips to token-based colors
  - Added starter import templates for hands-on learning:
    - `examples/packs/daily_github_pr_reviewer/`
    - `examples/packs/slack_release_notes_writer/`
    - `examples/packs/customer_support_drafter/`
  - Added a practical personal tutorial to build/zip/import/run your first pack:
    - `specs/packs/PERSONAL_TUTORIAL_FIRST_PACK.md`
  - Fixed Settings icon disappearance edge cases by rehydrating icons after async tab-content mutations.
  - Updated Automations (`#/agents`) top tabs to the same Settings-style underline tab treatment for consistent UX.
  - Restored multi-theme switching in Settings Appearance:
    - full theme list is back (`Web Control`, `Electric Blue`, `Emerald Night`, `Hello Bunny`, `Porcelain`, `Neon Riot`)
    - dropdown + quick-swatch selectors both apply themes instantly across the control panel
  - Hardened provider test behavior in Settings:
    - removed mixed `prompt_sync` + `prompt_async` test path
    - now runs a single async probe request to avoid run-conflict/stuck-wait behavior
    - extended provider-test wait timeout and improved status copy for non-`READY` successful replies
  - Isolated provider-test sessions from normal chat UX:
    - provider test uses internal non-workspace session metadata
    - chat session lists now hide internal `__provider_test__` sessions

- Internal execution tracking
  - Added implementation Kanban board:
    - `docs/internal/PACKS_PRESETS_IMPLEMENTATION_KANBAN.md`

## v0.3.28 (Unreleased)

  - Updated control panel automation copy to present advanced automation features without exposing internal V2 labels.
  - Refactored the `Automations` workspace (`#/agents`) into tabs: `Overview`, `Routines`, `Automations`, `Templates`, and `Runs & Approvals`.
  - Added guided walkthrough wizard (first-run + manual launch) for both routine and advanced automation setup flows.
  - Added URL-deep-linkable Automations UI state (`tab`, `wizard`, `flow`, `step`) for support and team handoff links.
  - Added lightweight Motion animation runtime for smoother tab/wizard panel transitions.
  - Extended animation coverage across routed views (cards/list/nav) with reduced-motion safeguards.
  - Fixed Swarm refresh race where polling/SSE re-renders could leave Swarm UI content visible after route changes.
  - Clarified Swarm positioning in UI as live orchestration (`Swarm (Live)`), with guidance to use Automations for persistent scheduled flows.
  - Fixed same-route hash/query navigation churn causing visible full-page flash on tab/wizard interactions (notably Automations), by using soft in-place rerenders and stale-render guards.
  - Improved Automation Builder clarity for per-agent model routing: provider/model now use settings-aware dropdowns with custom override options instead of manual free-text-only entry.
  - Fixed Automation Builder custom selection controls so choosing `Custom provider` / `Custom model` correctly enables manual input fields and keeps model selection usable.
  - Simplified Automation Builder agent policy inputs:
    - Skills input is plain text tags (comma-separated), not markdown/file-based.
    - MCP policy now uses connected-server selections from MCP config.
    - Tool policy now uses clear modes (`Standard`, `Read-only`, `Custom allow/deny`) instead of raw CSV-only mental model.
- Chat reliability and approvals-state fixes
  - Fixed delayed user-message rendering: user messages now appear immediately on send (optimistic render).
  - Fixed missing right-rail tool activity by normalizing additional tool event families (`session.tool_call`, `session.tool_result`, and tool message-part updates).
  - Fixed stale approval requests not clearing: pending-status filtering, `once` semantics for one-shot approvals, and session-change refresh now keep approvals list consistent.
- MCP and Composio connection fixes
  - Web control panel MCP form now supports auth modes (`auto`, `x-api-key`, `bearer`, `custom`, `none`) with Composio-aware auto-header behavior.
  - MCP connect failures now surface server-side `last_error` details in UI/toasts.
  - Fixed runtime MCP parser to accept streamable/SSE JSON-RPC responses during discovery (`initialize`, `tools/list`), resolving Composio `Invalid MCP JSON response: expected value at line 1 column 1` failures.
- Persistent Automations V2 backend rollout (additive APIs)
  - Added `automations/v2` endpoints for create/list/get/patch/delete, run-now, automation pause/resume, run pause/resume/cancel, run history, and SSE events.
  - Added persistent V2 stores (`automations_v2.json`, `automation_v2_runs.json`) with checkpoint metadata for resumable runs.
  - Added V2 scheduler/executor loops with DAG node dispatch and run checkpoint updates.
- Per-agent model selection in V2 flows
  - Added per-agent `model_policy` support and node-level model resolution, enabling mixed-cost agent fleets (cheap models for easy tasks, stronger models for hard tasks).
- Automation cost telemetry and accounting
  - Added run-level `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `total_tokens`, and `estimated_cost_usd` fields for routine/automation records.
  - Added provider-usage aggregation to attribute token usage to active automation/routine runs.
  - Added configurable estimation rate via `TANDEM_TOKEN_COST_PER_1K_USD` for dashboard cost metrics.
- Scheduler + policy enforcement hardening
  - Replaced cron no-op behavior with real cron evaluation (timezone-aware next-fire + misfire handling).
  - Tool allowlist/denylist enforcement now supports wildcard/prefix matching (`*`, `mcp.github.*`, `mcp.composio.*`) in runtime/session/capability checks.
- Hard pause behavior for active routine runs
  - Pausing a running routine now cancels active tracked session IDs immediately (not status-only), and pause responses include canceled session IDs.
- SDK/API management parity
  - Added API support for agent template lifecycle (`POST/PATCH/DELETE /agent-team/templates`).
  - Added TypeScript client support for `automationsV2` and agent-template create/update/delete methods.
  - Added Python client parity with `client.automations_v2` and agent-template create/update/delete methods.
- Control panel V2 builder and operator flow
  - Added Automation Builder V2 UI in `Agents` view with mission metadata, schedule fields, dynamic agent rows, per-agent model policy inputs, and DAG node editor.
  - Added Automations V2 list controls for run-now and pause/resume, plus run inspector actions for pause/resume/cancel.
  - Added one-click presets:
    - Engineering: `GitHub bug hunter`, `Code generation pipeline`, `Release notes + changelog`
    - Marketing/productivity: `Marketing content engine`, `Sales lead outreach`, `Inbox to tasks`
- Guide documentation updates (`guide/src`)
  - Updated SDK docs (`sdk/index`, `sdk/typescript`, `sdk/python`) for `automationsV2` / `automations_v2`, per-agent model routing examples, and agent template CRUD examples.
  - Updated MCP automation guide with a full `/automations/v2` DAG example and operations workflow.

## v0.3.27 (Unreleased)

- Engine dynamic tool routing + context compaction
  - Added intent-aware tool router in `tandem-core` to avoid publishing full tool catalogs on every provider call.
  - New request controls on async prompt paths:
    - `toolMode`: `auto | none | required`
    - `toolAllowlist`: explicit tool-name allowlist
    - `contextMode`: `auto | compact | full`
  - In `toolMode=auto`, engine now runs a no-tools first pass and escalates only when completion/user intent indicates tools are required.
  - MCP tools are hidden by default unless explicitly requested by intent or allowlist.
  - Added router tunables:
    - `TANDEM_TOOL_ROUTER_ENABLED` (default enabled)
    - `TANDEM_TOOL_ROUTER_MAX_TOOLS` (default `12`)
    - `TANDEM_TOOL_ROUTER_MAX_TOOLS_EXPANDED` (default `24`)

  - Server prompt-context hook now skips memory search/injection for low-signal short greetings/chitchat, reducing unnecessary token bloat.
- SDK parity updates for routing controls
  - TypeScript client: `promptAsync` / `promptAsyncParts` now accept routing options (`toolMode`, `toolAllowlist`, `contextMode`).
  - Python client: `prompt_async` / `prompt_async_parts` now accept `tool_mode`, `tool_allowlist`, `context_mode`.
- Engine/channel stability hardening for stuck runs
  - Fixed startup race in server prompt-context hook that could panic with `runtime accessed before startup completion` during boot.
  - Added provider stream timeout fail-safes in engine loop so stuck upstream calls fail and release active runs:
    - `TANDEM_PROVIDER_STREAM_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `30000`)
    - `TANDEM_PROVIDER_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `90000`)
    - `TANDEM_PROMPT_CONTEXT_HOOK_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `5000`)
    - `TANDEM_BASH_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `30000`)
  - This prevents long-lived stuck active runs that caused downstream `SESSION_RUN_CONFLICT` symptoms across web chat and channel adapters.
- Control panel chat stream watchdog hardening
  - Increased stream no-event and max-window thresholds.
  - Added run-settlement polling before declaring a stuck run, reducing false stuck/error toasts during slow provider/tool phases.

- Branding/identity surface updates
  - VPS Web Portal now reads configured identity aliases and renders portal/bot labels dynamically.
  - Control Panel now reads configured identity aliases and renders control-panel/bot labels dynamically.
  - Control Panel Settings now includes an Identity & Personality editor (canonical name, control-panel alias, preset, custom instructions).
  - Desktop (Tauri) Settings now includes a Bot Identity section (canonical name, desktop alias, preset, custom instructions).
  - Control Panel chat and Desktop chat now show configured bot identity names in assistant message/header labels.
  - Added optional bot avatar support via `identity.bot.avatar_url`, including avatar upload controls in Desktop/Control Panel settings and avatar rendering in Desktop chat plus portal/control-panel shell/chat identity UI.
  - Avatar uploads are now normalized server-side (decode/resize/re-encode), so larger source images are accepted and stored in a bounded form.
  - Core UI/TUI assistant-facing copy reduces hardcoded Tandem naming in primary runtime labels/placeholders.
- npm publish reliability (control panel)
  - Added missing `repository` metadata in `packages/tandem-control-panel/package.json`.
  - Fixes npm provenance validation failure for `@frumu/tandem-panel` publishes from CI (`publish-registries`).

- Engine tool-loop retry protection and tuning
  - Added duplicate-signature loop guard for non-read-only tools (including repeated `bash` signatures) to stop runaway repeated provider/tool cycles.
  - Added deterministic terminal summary when duplicate-signature guard triggers, reducing token burn from repeated retries.
  - Added env tuning controls:
    - `TANDEM_MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS` (max provider/tool loop turns per run; default `25`)
    - `TANDEM_TOOL_LOOP_DUPLICATE_SIGNATURE_LIMIT` (max repeated identical mutable-tool signatures before guard; defaults: shell `2`, other mutable tools `3`)

- Telegram MarkdownV2 rendering and delivery hardening
  - Telegram heading rendering now outputs readable heading text style (instead of visible escaped `###` markers).
  - Long Telegram responses now split on markdown-safe boundaries where possible, reducing entity breakage across chunks.
  - Existing Telegram fallback behavior remains: if MarkdownV2 send fails, message retries as plain text.
- Telegram style profiles (bot presentation control)
  - Added Telegram style profile support: `default`, `compact`, `friendly`, `ops`.
  - Profile can be configured through channel config and is applied before MarkdownV2 conversion.
  - Added control-panel support for selecting Telegram style profile in Channels settings.
- Control panel routine automation UX + approvals
  - Added one-click routine policy shortcut: **Allow everything** (all tools, external integrations allowed, no approval gate).
  - Added Approve/Deny controls for pending routine/automation runs across:
    - routine cards
    - automations list
    - recent runs
    - run inspector
  - Closes the control-panel gap where approval-gated runs had no in-UI resolution path.

## v0.3.26 (Unreleased)

- Channel attachment ingestion + engine dispatch parity
  - Channel dispatcher now sends uploads as explicit `file` parts to `prompt_async` (instead of text-only attachment summaries).
  - Telegram/Discord/Slack flows preserve attachment metadata (`path`, `url`, `mime`, `filename`) for run prompts, resource references, and memory records.
  - Discord and Slack adapters now download inbound attachments to local `channel_uploads` storage, matching Telegram’s local-persistence behavior.
- Multimodal image dispatch for OpenAI-compatible providers
  - Provider message model is now attachment-aware and can encode image attachments in OpenAI-compatible `messages[].content` array payloads.
  - Engine loop now maps inbound image file parts into runtime provider attachments on first-iteration user context.
  - Local file attachment paths are converted to bounded data URLs before provider dispatch when needed.
  - Added model capability guardrails that fail fast when image input is attempted on a likely non-vision model.
- Engine storage visibility API
  - Added `GET /global/storage/files` to list files under the engine storage root with optional `path` and `limit` query controls.
  - Response includes root/base metadata and per-file size/mtime fields.
  - Added traversal protection: rejects absolute/parent-directory path traversal in requested subpath.

## v0.3.25 (Unreleased)

- Agent Swarm headless example (`examples/agent-swarm`)
  - Added manager/worker/reviewer/tester prompts and a full manager orchestration script using Tandem sessions, runs, event bus updates, shared resources, approvals, and routines.
  - Added managed worktree helper scripts (`create_worktree.sh`, `cleanup_worktrees.sh`) and a routine health-check script for Telegram notifications and GitHub MCP check polling via Arcade.
  - Added routine definition `routines/check_swarm_health.json` (cron every 10 minutes, approval-gated).
  - Added example test coverage for deterministic task transitions, manager registry updates, worktree idempotency, and MCP auth-loop prevention.
- Shared resource key policy update
  - `swarm.active_tasks` is now accepted as a valid shared resource key for swarm task registry storage.

- Global Memory first-class runtime path (engine/server)
  - Added durable global memory storage in `memory.sqlite` with FTS5-backed retrieval (`memory_records` + `memory_records_fts`), replacing transient in-process memory API state.
  - Added automatic ingestion capture from run outputs and event streams:
    - user messages
    - assistant finals
    - tool inputs/outputs
    - permission requests/replies
    - MCP auth-required/pending challenges
    - todo/question planning events
  - Added secret-safety write gate with scrub/block behavior before persistence and redaction metadata on stored records.
- Memory retrieval now runs during planning loops, not only run start
  - Introduced engine-loop prompt-context augmentation hook and server implementation that performs per-iteration memory search/injection.
  - Added memory context injection observability and scoring telemetry:
    - `memory.search.performed`
    - `memory.context.injected`
  - Added write lifecycle observability:
    - `memory.write.attempted`
    - `memory.write.succeeded`
    - `memory.write.skipped`
- Memory API surface expansion
  - Added `POST /memory/demote` for private/demoted tier fallback without deleting memory.
  - Existing `/memory/put`, `/memory/search`, `/memory/list`, `/memory/promote`, `/memory/{id}` now operate on durable global records.
  - Updated TypeScript/Python SDK memory clients for response-shape compatibility and added memory demote client helpers.
  - Synced API/Event contracts (`contracts/http.md`, `contracts/events.json`) and OpenAPI route summaries with the global-memory endpoint/event surface.
  - Refreshed user-facing docs and guides (README EN/zh-CN, SDK READMEs, guide SDK/headless/tools/engine command pages) for global-memory defaults and demotion workflow.

- MCP auth/retry behavior and loop hardening
  - Improved MCP auth challenge extraction to prefer structured payload fields (`structuredContent.message`, `structuredContent.authorization_url`) over noisy nested text blobs.
  - Sanitized/truncated auth-required messaging so web/TUI/channel users see clean authorization prompts instead of escaped JSON/instruction payload dumps.
  - Added stronger run-time auth/guard short-circuit behavior to reduce repeated MCP/tool-call churn in a single run.
- Engine run guard and failure ergonomics
  - Tightened guard-budget handling to fail fast in non-productive tool loops and return deterministic run-scoped messaging.
  - Reduced model-generated fallback ambiguity around “session limits” by keeping budget diagnostics explicit and per-run.
- Agent quickstart runtime stability updates
  - Chat send path now best-effort cancels stale active runs before starting a new run, reducing cross-send run carryover issues.
  - `Auto-allow all` preference now persists across portal restarts/reloads.
  - Quickstart run submission remains model-explicit and aligned with selected provider/model routing behavior.
- Provider compatibility hardening
  - Strengthened OpenAI-compatible function/tool serialization (name normalization + schema normalization + alias round-trip) to reduce strict-validator 400 failures with MCP-heavy tool sets.
- Quality and regression coverage
  - Added targeted tests for MCP auth parsing/message sanitization and per-run guard-budget summarization behavior.

## v0.3.24 (Unreleased)

- MCP reliability and auth hardening
  - Clarified and hardened MCP auth signaling via `mcp.auth.required` across engine/runtime and web chat handling.
  - MCP server runtime state now tracks auth/session continuity fields for operators and UIs:
    - `last_auth_challenge`
    - `mcp_session_id`
  - MCP connect/refresh failure handling now clears stale tool cache/session state and returns deterministic reconnect/error outcomes.
  - MCP connection bootstrap and reconnect behavior now better aligns tool availability with actual upstream server state.
- MCP tool-call resilience
  - Added engine-level MCP argument normalization before `tools/call` to recover common schema/key mismatches (for example camelCase/snake_case drift and common alias recovery such as `name -> task_title` where applicable).
  - This normalization runs in engine runtime and benefits all clients (web, TUI, channels), not only manual CLI calls.
- Agent quickstart runtime stability fixes
  - Provider setup gating and startup flow now prevent entering broken chat state when provider/model config is missing.
  - Chat now surfaces clearer run failure details and MCP auth-required diagnostics in-stream.
  - Stabilized chat/runtime behavior for non-response and blank-run regressions.
  - Aligned quickstart memory defaults with expected global-memory usage behavior in deployed engine setups.
  - Corrected quickstart proxy/auth behavior for `/engine` and portal key handling.
- SDK/npm publish reliability
  - Fixed `@frumu/tandem-client` npm provenance requirements with repository metadata alignment.
  - Hardened TS client npm publish flow in CI by ensuring install/build prerequisites (`typescript`, DOM libs, `tsup` + `tsc` declaration build path).
- Registry workflow controls and docs sync
  - Added independent PyPI publish toggle in release workflow so Python publishing can be controlled separately from npm.
  - Synced docs and top-level readme artifacts (including zh-CN parity and docs URL/badge updates) to match current release/runtime behavior.

## v0.3.23 (Unreleased)

- First SDK release announcement (TypeScript + Python)
  - `v0.3.23` is the first release where Tandem officially announces both client SDKs as release deliverables:
    - TypeScript: `@frumu/tandem-client`
    - Python: `tandem-client`
- SDK and example alignment (TypeScript + Python)
  - Added explicit TS SDK token lifecycle support via `TandemClient.setToken(token)` to support auth updates without rebuilding calling code.
  - Migrated `examples/agent-quickstart` to the current `@frumu/tandem-client` API surface:
    - replaced legacy `client.config.*` and `client.tools.*` usage
    - updated session/message/permissions flows to current namespaces
    - aligned run-state and event-stream handling with current SDK event/model contracts
  - Resolved strict TypeScript compile issues across quickstart pages so `agent-quickstart` builds cleanly.
- Release tooling parity
  - Updated `scripts/bump-version.sh` and `scripts/bump-version.ps1` to include both SDK packages:
    - `packages/tandem-client-ts/package.json`
    - `packages/tandem-client-py/pyproject.toml`
  - Ensures version bumps stay synchronized across engine/runtime crates, npm packages, and Python SDK releases.

## v0.3.22 (Unreleased)

- Engine-first context-driving reliability expansion
  - Extended engine context-run/runtime wiring used by Desktop + TUI: sequenced events, replay/checkpoint access, deterministic next-step selection, and todo->step synchronization for long-running workflows.
  - Reinforced source-of-truth model so operator surfaces consume engine state/events rather than transcript inference.
- Premium Blackboard UX for long runs (Desktop Orchestrator + Command Center)
  - Added shared Blackboard panel with docked/expanded/fullscreen modes.
  - Added decision spine + lineage rail views with selectable decision history and attached context nodes.
  - Added predictable follow behavior:
    - auto-focus only on new `meta_next_step_selected` decisions
    - manual navigation pauses follow until explicitly re-enabled
  - Added drift details drawer with mismatch flags, checkpoint/event markers, and copyable debug bundle payload.
  - Added keyboard-first controls (`E`, `F`, `Space`, `/`, `Esc`) and baseline fullscreen accessibility handling.
- Performance and test hardening
  - Switched blackboard refresh to event-family-gated + debounced fetches with `last_blackboard_refresh_seq` watermark to avoid redundant refresh bursts.
  - Added dedicated blackboard test target (`pnpm test:blackboard`) covering projection/filtering, follow-mode state, refresh policy, and drift UI state contracts.
- Orchestrator execution reliability and continuity
  - Planning now runs in two passes (analysis -> planner), improving task decomposition quality for complex objectives.
  - Builder prompts now include continuation context from the orchestrator context-pack so retries/resumes keep decision rationale.
  - Failed-task retry now preserves task session context by default; load/restart restores task session bindings from checkpoint snapshots.
  - Budget token usage now accounts for prompt + response across planner analysis, planner, builder, and validator calls.
  - Added explicit fail-fast checks for file-modifying tasks when recovery attempts invoke no tools, or only read-only tools.
  - Resume now preserves per-task failure rationale in prompt context to prevent "start from scratch" retries.
- Blackboard parity improvements (Orchestrator + Command Center)
  - Blackboard decision/reliability/task-sync projections now recognize orchestrator runtime events (for example `context_pack_built`, planning, task lifecycle, and run failure events), not only context-run `meta_next_step_selected`.
  - Refresh triggers were expanded to these orchestrator event families so blackboard state updates consistently during active runs.
  - Added `task_trace` coverage in projection/refresh/filtering so first-tool/stage details are visible in blackboard rails.
- Filesystem and tool-path reliability hardening
  - Path normalization now rejects synthetic placeholders (for example `files/directories`, `tool/policy`) and recognizes document extensions (`.pdf/.docx/.pptx/.xlsx/.rtf`) when recovering file targets.
  - `read` now returns explicit structured failures (`path_not_found`, `path_is_directory`, `read_text_failed`) instead of silent empty output.
  - Sandbox-denied responses now include actionable diagnostics (`workspace_root`, `effective_cwd`, and suggested in-workspace target path).
  - Windows verbatim paths (`\\?\...`) are accepted when they are still inside workspace root, reducing false sandbox denials.

## v0.3.21 (Unreleased)

- Global storage path standardization
  - Standardized global Tandem storage fallbacks to OS-native app-data roots (`.../tandem`) across engine/runtime/server/channels/skills/core, replacing scattered relative `.tandem` fallbacks for global state.
  - Added `TANDEM_HOME` override support in shared storage path resolution for deterministic custom install roots (servers/CI).
- Registry publish reliability
  - Fixed crates publish ordering so `crates/tandem-agent-teams` is published before `crates/tandem-tools`, preventing crates.io dependency-resolution failures during release runs.

## v0.3.20 - 2026-02-25

- Tandem TUI reliability and workflow upgrade
  - Small pastes (1-2 lines) now insert directly without `[Pasted ...]` markers; CRLF paste payloads are normalized to prevent line-overlap rendering issues.
  - Fixed multiline composer height calculation so explicit newlines grow input height correctly (prevents second-line overlap/cropping).
  - Agent fanout now auto-switches mode from `plan` to `orchestrate` before team delegation to avoid plan-mode approval/clarification blockers.
  - Expanded agent-team fanout integration: coordinated `TeamCreate` + delegated `task` routing, local mailbox/session binding, and teammate alias normalization (`A2`/`a2`/`agent-2`).
- Provider/tool runtime hotfixes for OpenRouter/OpenAI-compatible flows
  - Fixed streaming parser compatibility for providers that emit content/tool calls in `choices[].message` (instead of only `choices[].delta`), eliminating empty assistant replies and missed tool execution in affected sessions.
  - Added explicit default `max_tokens` cap (`2048`, env-overridable via `TANDEM_PROVIDER_MAX_TOKENS`) on OpenAI-compatible requests to prevent accidental high-budget sends (for example `65536`) that can cause 402 Payment Required failures during simple tool prompts.

## v0.3.19

- Stress benchmark parity + reliability upgrade
  - Server-side VPS Stress Lab scenarios (`remote`, `file`, `inline`) now measure true end-to-end async run completion (provider/tool included), not fast submit-path timing.
  - Added explicit provider/model resolution + injection for server-side stress prompt runs so LLM calls are guaranteed in prompt scenarios.
  - Fixed Stress Lab line-chart NaN rendering edge cases on sparse/all-zero series.
- Cross-system comparison support (Tandem vs OpenCode)
  - Added OpenCode benchmark API client wiring in portal (`/results/latest`, `/results/history`, `/results/by-date`, `/health`).
  - Added in-page comparison panel with scenario-mapped deltas (avg/p95 and error context) and 30-day baseline context.
- Engine + diagnostics improvements
  - Added request latency instrumentation for key engine routes: `session.command`, `session.get`, and `session.list`.
  - Improved external benchmark-service compatibility by aligning `/api/v1` health/read routing expectations.
- Tandem TUI reliability and workflow upgrade
  - Upgraded TUI terminal stack to `ratatui 0.30` + `crossterm 0.29` and replaced third-party throbber usage with local spinner rendering.
  - Added safer Windows paste handling with token placeholders to prevent line-by-line replay floods and accidental sends during large pastes.
  - Fixed plan-mode request/question handoff loops that could repeatedly hit `409 session has active run` by queueing follow-up prompts safely when runs are busy.
  - Improved request-center answer handling and visibility with clearer selection behavior and explicit "submitted answers" confirmation.
  - Restored task-list persistence when reopening historical plan sessions by parsing all persisted tool-call variants (`tool`, `tool_call`, `tool_use`).
  - Added sessions list deletion controls (`d`/`Delete`) and explicit `/agent fanout [n]` command to force multi-agent grid fanout (default 4).

## v0.3.18

- Provider model selection hotfix (OpenRouter/API-key env interactions)
  - Fixed env-layer provider bootstrap so setting `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` no longer hard-overrides OpenRouter default model to `openai/gpt-4o-mini`.
  - Preserves configured model choices (for example `z-ai/glm-5`) across engine restarts in VPS/web setups.
  - Model override from env is now explicit-only: applied only when a model env var is set, not just because an API key exists.

## v0.3.17

- Channel reliability and permission bootstrap
  - Channel-created sessions now include practical default permission rules to avoid hidden permission deadlocks.
  - Channel dispatcher now streams events at session scope and parses `message.part.updated` text deltas + additional terminal run variants for more reliable connector replies.
- Telegram diagnostics quality
  - Poll failures now include richer debug context and non-success status/body previews for easier production debugging.
- Portal run-debug quality (limited to observability)
  - Added global pending-approval visibility/action and clearer “no pending” messaging.
  - Web examples now prefer session-level SSE attach plus clearer watchdog trace events to reduce “connected/ready with no deltas” confusion.

## v0.3.16

- AI hotfix: What's New release-note alignment
  - The What's New overlay now fetches release notes by installed app tag from GitHub at runtime.
  - If release-note fetch fails or body text is unavailable, the overlay no longer shows stale bundled notes and instead points users to the latest release page.
- Plan execution task-state integrity
  - **Execute Pending Tasks** now enforces a strict completion contract: task execution is only considered complete when todo statuses are updated via `todowrite`.
  - Assistant text like "all tasks completed" is no longer trusted on its own; mismatches now surface an explicit execution-incomplete error.
  - Execution payload now includes pending-only tasks so the chat prompt and Tasks sidebar stay aligned.

## v0.3.15

- Breaking web tool migration:
  - `webfetch_document` was removed.
  - `webfetch` is now markdown-first and returns structured JSON output by default.
  - Use `webfetch_html` when raw HTML output is explicitly required.
- Custom provider + llama-swap compatibility and diagnostics:
  - Fixed custom provider config propagation so enabled custom endpoints/models are registered in engine runtime config (`providers.custom`) and selected correctly.
  - Fixed OpenAI-compatible endpoint normalization to prevent malformed URLs (for example `/v1/v1/chat/completions`) from trailing/duplicated path input.
  - Added support for custom/non-built-in provider IDs in engine provider registry (prevents fallback to `local`-only configured providers).
  - Added short retry handling for transient connection/timeout provider-call failures.
  - Improved provider error messaging with endpoint + failure category details to make connectivity issues actionable.
- Settings UX improvements for custom providers:
  - Added explicit success/error feedback after clicking **Save Custom Provider**.
  - Updated Anthropic/OpenAI model selection UX to text-input-first with refreshed current model suggestions and clearer placeholders.
- Channel integrations: expanded slash-command control/visibility directly from Telegram/Discord/Slack:
  - `/run` for active run status
  - `/cancel` (and `/abort`) for run cancellation
  - `/todos` for session todo visibility
  - `/requests` to view pending permission/question requests
  - `/answer <question_id> <text>` to reply to pending question prompts
  - `/providers` and `/models [provider]` for provider/model catalog visibility
- Channel integrations: added `/model <model_id>` to switch the active model on the current default provider from chat channels (without adding provider/token switching flows).

## v0.3.14

- AI hotfix: endless update prompt/version skew
  - Desktop now prefers bundled engine binaries when AppData sidecar binaries are stale, preventing false "You have v0.3.0" prompts after upgrading.
  - Engine update overlay version formatting is normalized to avoid duplicated prefixes (for example `vv0.3.12`).

## v0.3.12

- AI hotfix: MCP runtime compatibility
  - Desktop now falls back to `GET /mcp` server `tool_cache` when `GET /mcp/tools` returns `404` on mixed-version engines.
  - Fixes Extensions MCP runtime load failures (`Failed to load MCP runtime`) while older/newer engine components are temporarily out of sync.
- Registry publish hotfix
  - Fixed crates publish ordering/dependency coverage for `tandem-providers`/`tandem-memory` and `tandem-document`/`tandem-tools` dependency chains.

- Issue #14 fix (custom providers + live model lists):
  - Fixed `custom` provider routing so custom endpoint/model selections are honored for chat/automation dispatch.
  - Provider settings now prefer engine-catalog model IDs (OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenCode Zen) when available, instead of static-only dropdown content.
- Updates + release metadata reliability:
  - Settings release notes now fall back to updater `latest.json` when GitHub Releases API is unavailable.
  - Desktop CSP now explicitly allows GitHub release metadata hosts used by updater/release note fetches.
  - Sidecar updater status now reports bundled-engine version from app metadata instead of stale stored beta values.

## v0.3.9 (Unreleased)

- Memory Consolidation: Added opt-in LLM summarization of session memory using the cheapest available configured provider (prioritizing local/free options like Ollama, Groq, OpenRouter). Automatically triggers as a background task when a session completes.
- Channel Tool Policy: Added `channels.tool_policy` config option (`allow_all`, `deny_all`, `require_approval`) and `TANDEM_CHANNEL_TOOL_POLICY` env var to govern agent tool execution in messaging channels.
- Channel Session Metadata: Upgraded channel session tracking to persist detailed `SessionRecord` mapping (timestamps, channel, sender) instead of bare session IDs.
- Headless web admin: Added embedded single-file `/admin` UI served by `tandem-server` (no external runtime assets).
- Realtime admin updates: Added SSE-driven refresh behavior with polling fallback for live admin visibility.
- New channel admin APIs:
  - `GET /channels/status`
  - `PUT /channels/{name}`
  - `DELETE /channels/{name}`
  - `POST /admin/reload-config`
- New memory admin APIs:
  - `GET /memory`
  - `DELETE /memory/{id}`
- Engine CLI: Added `tandem-engine serve --web-ui` and `--web-ui-prefix` (plus env equivalents).
- Runtime wiring: Channel listener lifecycle now integrates with server startup/reload paths for headless operation.
- Security hardening: Embedded admin responses now include strict CSP/security headers.
- Agent Command Center (desktop): Added initial command-center UI in Orchestrator for live agent-team missions/instances/approvals.
- Agent-Team approvals: Added explicit spawn approval decision endpoints (`POST /agent-team/approvals/spawn/{id}/approve|deny`).
- Docs: Updated engine command reference for web admin flags and headless control surface.
- Desktop channels: Fixed a startup race so saved Telegram/Discord/Slack bot-token connections persist correctly across app/engine restarts after vault unlock.
- Model routing: Fixed provider/model dispatch so selected models are used across chat/session/orchestrator flows instead of fallback defaults.
- Model selection persistence: Chat and Command Center now persist explicit `selected_model` routing in provider config.
- Provider runtime behavior: Streaming/completion calls now honor per-request model overrides.
- OpenRouter attribution: Added Tandem-origin headers for provider requests.
- Memory reliability: Added startup backup + self-heal recovery for malformed/incompatible memory vector tables.
- Command Center reliability: Fixed paused/failed status mapping and disabled launch while runs are active.
- Autonomous swarm permissions: Orchestrator/Command Center sessions now auto-allow shell permissions in autonomous mode.
- Shell robustness: Empty shell calls now fail fast with `BASH_COMMAND_MISSING` instead of hanging until timeout.
- Windows compatibility: Added translation for common Unix-style agent shell commands (`ls -la`, `find ... -type f -name ...`) to PowerShell equivalents.
- Stream stability: Reduced false stream watchdog degraded events while tools are still pending.
- Command Center reliability: Added strict `read`/`write` tool-arg validation (JSON object + non-empty `path`) with fail-fast `INVALID_TOOL_ARGS` handling to prevent endless retry loops.
- Orchestrator error clarity: Replaced generic Windows `os error 3` workspace mismatch messaging with structured classification (`WORKSPACE_NOT_FOUND`, path-not-found fail-fast, timeout codes).
- Workspace safety: Task child sessions now pin explicitly to orchestrator workspace path and preflight-check workspace existence before session creation.
- Workspace propagation fix (CC-001): New runs now persist canonical `workspace_root`, and tool executions receive explicit `workspace_root`/`effective_cwd` context so filesystem operations always use the selected workspace.
- Workspace switch hot-reload fix (CC-001): Switching active workspace now invalidates stale orchestrator engines bound to previous roots, preventing agents from reading/writing in old directories.
- Selected Run readability (CC-002): Added objective line-clamp with `Show more` / `Show less` in Command Center Selected Run panel.
- Runs observability (CC-003): Runs list now shows status badges, started/ended timestamps, and failed-run error snippets.
- Tool history integrity: Tool execution IDs now include session/message/part context to avoid cross-session `part_id` collisions in diagnostics.
- File-tool stability: Increased `read`/`write` timeout budget to reduce premature synthetic timeout terminals on larger repos.
- Engine memory tools:
  - Added `memory_store` for persisting agent-learned memory in `session`/`project`/`global` tiers.
  - Added `memory_list` for browsing/auditing stored memory by scope/tier.
- Global memory support:
  - `memory_search` now supports `tier=global` with explicit opt-in (`allow_global=true` or `TANDEM_ENABLE_GLOBAL_MEMORY=1`).
  - Global tier remains gated by default to preserve isolation without explicit enablement.
- Engine memory DB alignment:
  - `tandem-engine` now auto-sets `TANDEM_MEMORY_DB_PATH` to shared Tandem `memory.sqlite` when unset so connected apps/tools use the same knowledge base.
- Engine-native OS awareness:
  - Added canonical engine-detected runtime context (`os`, `arch`, `shell_family`, `path_style`) shared across server APIs/events and session metadata.
  - `session.run.started` and `/global/health` now include `environment` metadata for cross-client diagnostics (Desktop, TUI, HTTP clients).
  - `tandem-core` prompt assembly now injects a deterministic `[Execution Environment]` block by default (`TANDEM_OS_AWARE_PROMPTS` toggle).
- Cross-platform shell hardening:
  - Non-Windows shell execution now uses POSIX shell (`sh -lc`) instead of PowerShell fallback.
  - Windows shell guardrails now translate common Unix command patterns, block unsafe untranslatable Unix-only commands, and return structured metadata (`os_guardrail_applied`, `translated_command`, `guardrail_reason`).
  - Added OS/path mismatch classification (`OS_MISMATCH`) and suppression of repeated identical mismatch-prone shell retries.
- Documentation:
  - Added CLI examples for `memory_store`, `memory_list`, and global memory operations.
  - Updated engine README with global memory enablement and shared DB behavior notes.
- Quality:
  - Added/updated tool tests for global-memory opt-in gating and scope validation.
- MCP Automated Agents:
  - Added dedicated `Agent Automation` desktop page (separate from Command Center) for scheduled bots + MCP connector control.
  - Added Mission Workshop and ready templates (Daily Research, Issue Triage, Release Reporter) with `webfetch_document`-forward defaults.
  - Added run triage UX: event rail chips, run filters, and run-details panel with reason/timeline/output/artifact visibility.
  - Added sidecar compatibility fallback from `/automations` to legacy `/routines` to reduce mixed-version 404 loops.
  - Added automation model-routing controls and presets (OpenRouter/OpenCode Zen examples) and emitted `routine.run.model_selected` events.
  - Hardened automation `model_policy` validation/patch semantics (including clear with `model_policy: {}`).
  - Expanded guide docs for MCP automated agent setup, headless operation, provider onboarding, and release-readiness checklist.
- Contributor thanks:
  - Thanks to [@iridite](https://github.com/iridite) for PR #12 (ProviderCard i18n namespace fix).
  - Thanks for PR #11 (`feat: enhance ReadTool to support document formats`) moving document extraction toward shared engine-side crate usage (`tandem-document`).

## v0.3.7 - 2026-02-18

## v0.3.6 - 2026-02-18

- TUI startup reliability: Added stale shared-engine detection at connect time (version-aware).
- TUI auto-recovery: Added `TANDEM_ENGINE_STALE_POLICY` (default `auto_replace`) so stale engines are replaced automatically instead of silently attached.
- TUI port fallback: When stale/default shared port is occupied, TUI now spawns managed engine on an available port.
- TUI diagnostics: `/engine status` now includes required version, active stale policy, and connection source (`shared-attached` or `managed-local`).
- Release alignment: Bumped Rust crates, app manifests, and npm wrapper packages to `0.3.6`.

## v0.3.3 - 2026-02-18

- Agent Teams: Added server-side Agent Teams foundations in `tandem-server` with shared spawn-policy gating across orchestrator/UI/tool entrypoints.

- Security: Added engine API token auth hardening with keychain-first token persistence, desktop masked/reveal/copy controls, and TUI `/engine token` commands.
- Security: Fixed provider key drift by routing auth to runtime-only `/auth/{provider}` handling instead of config-secret persistence.
- Security: `PATCH /config` and `PATCH /global/config` now reject `api_key`/`apiKey` fields with `400 CONFIG_SECRET_REJECTED`.
- Security: TUI and desktop now sync provider keys from keystore to runtime auth (`/auth`) instead of writing keys through config patches.
- Security: Fixed a beta regression where provider keys could appear in plaintext in Tandem config files in specific config-patch flows.
- Networking: Added CORS handling to engine HTTP routes for browser clients using custom auth headers (`X-Tandem-Token`).

- Plan Mode: Fixed `todowrite` empty-argument loops (`todo list updated: 0 items`) by normalizing common todo payload shapes and skipping true empty calls.
- Plan Mode: Added structured clarification fallback (`question.asked`) when no concrete task list can be produced, instead of leaving planning in prose-only follow-up.
- Plan Mode: Tightened todo fallback extraction to structured checklist/numbered lines only, preventing plain-text clarification prose from becoming phantom tasks.
- Desktop UX: Restored walkthrough-question overlays when prompts arrive via `permission(tool=question)` by normalizing into the question modal flow.
- Desktop UX: Scoped permission prompts to the active session to prevent cross-session/parallel-client approval bleed.
- TUI Startup: Engine bootstrap now runs before PIN entry, keeping startup on the matrix/connect screen until engine availability is confirmed.
- Engine Networking: Default engine port standardized to `39731` (instead of `3000`) to reduce frontend port conflicts; desktop/TUI honor env overrides for endpoint selection.
- TUI Download UX: Added byte-based download progress, install-phase messaging, and surfaced last download error details in the connect view.
- TUI Reliability: Engine download failures now support retry/backoff in-process instead of requiring a full app restart.
- TUI Debug Flow: Debug builds now fall back to GitHub release download when no local dev engine binary is present.
- TUI Keystore Recovery: Corrupt/unreadable keystore files now route to create/recovery flow rather than repeated unlock failure loops.
- Skills: Expanded discovery to support multiple project/global ecosystem directories with deterministic project-over-global precedence.
- Skills: Added per-agent `skills` activation controls and universal mode-level access for the `skill` tool.
- Memory: Wired `src-tauri` to consume shared `crates/tandem-memory` directly and removed duplicated local memory implementation files.
- Memory: Added strict `memory_search` tool in `tandem-tools` with enforced session/project scoping and blocked global tier access.
- Memory UX: Added embedding health surface (`embedding_status`, `embedding_reason`) to memory retrieval events and settings, with chat/settings badges.
- Memory UX: Persisted memory lifecycle telemetry into tool history (`memory.lookup`, `memory.store`) so chat badges and console events survive session reload.
- Memory UX: Fixed a chat race where memory events could arrive before assistant text, causing missing badges despite console memory events being present.
- Memory Reliability: Added startup SQLite integrity check + auto backup/reset recovery for malformed `memory.sqlite` databases.
- Windows: Fixed `cargo test -p tandem-memory --lib` link-time CRT mismatch (`LNK2038`) between `esaxx-rs` and `ort-sys` via vendored `esaxx-rs` build patch.
- Desktop: Stream watchdog now skips degraded status while idle with no active runs or tool calls.

## v0.2.25 (2026-02-12)

- Skills: Added canonical Core 9 marketing starter templates (`product-marketing-context`, `content-strategy`, `seo-audit`, `social-content`, `copywriting`, `copy-editing`, `email-sequence`, `competitor-alternatives`, `launch-strategy`).
- Skills: Template installer now copies the full template directory (including `references/`, scripts, and assets), not only `SKILL.md`.
- Skills: Fixed starter-template parsing issues caused by UTF-8 BOM in `SKILL.md` files (`missing or malformed frontmatter`).
- Skills: Fixed invalid YAML `tags` in `development-estimation` and `mode-builder`.
- Skills UI: Prioritized canonical marketing skills over legacy/fallback marketing templates in recommendations.
- Marketing workflow: Replaced `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` references with `scripts/marketing/_shared/product-marketing-context.md` and bundled shared context templates.

- Release: Bumped version metadata to `0.2.25` across app manifests.

## v0.2.24 (2026-02-12)

- Modes: Added full custom modes MVP across backend + frontend with server-side enforcement and safe fallbacks.
- Modes UI: Added `Extensions -> Modes` with two views:
  - Guided Builder (recommended)
  - Advanced Editor
- Guided Builder: Added step-by-step mode creation for non-technical users, including preview-before-apply.
- AI Assist: Added optional AI-assisted mode creation flow with a bundled `mode-builder` skill template and paste-and-parse JSON preview.
- Mode Icons: Added icon selection for custom modes and icon rendering in the chat mode selector.
- Mode Selector: Switched to dynamic mode list (built-in + custom) with compact custom-mode descriptions.
- Memory: Auto-index on project load now defaults to enabled (`true`) for new settings state.
- Updates: Fixed version metadata mismatches by syncing `tauri.conf.json`, `package.json`, and `Cargo.toml` so auto-updates detect new releases correctly.

## v0.2.22 (2026-02-11)

- Orchestrator: Fixed a cross-project state bug where opening Orchestrator could load an old completed run from another project.
- Orchestrator: Switching projects (or adding/activating a project) now clears stale orchestrator run selection so each workspace starts clean.
- Orchestrator: Auto-selection now resumes only active runs (`planning`, `awaiting_approval`, `executing`, `paused`) and no longer auto-opens terminal history (`completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`).

## v0.2.21 (2026-02-11)

- Model selector UX: Replaced horizontal provider chips with a compact provider dropdown (`All` + visible providers) to scale cleanly when many providers are available.
- Model selector search: Added provider-aware query syntax via `provider:<id-or-name>` (for example `provider:openrouter sonnet`) while keeping normal model name/id search.
- Model selector clarity: Added inline context text ("Showing configured providers + local") so hidden-provider behavior is explicit.
- Model selector reliability: Provider filter now safely resets to `All` if the selected provider disappears after catalog refresh.
- Empty states: Model dropdown now reports provider-specific no-match states (for example "No models found for OpenRouter").
- Files: Fixed fullscreen file preview readability by using a stronger, opaque surface backdrop so text no longer blends into transparent/gradient themes.

## v0.2.20 (2026-02-11)

- Sidecar updates: Switched OpenCode release discovery to paginated GitHub Releases metadata (`per_page=20` + additional pages), avoiding fragile single-endpoint latest behavior.
- Sidecar updates: Selects the newest compatible release for the current platform/arch by filtering release assets, skipping drafts, and excluding prereleases unless beta channel is enabled.
- Sidecar updates: Added API-efficiency protections (ETag/Last-Modified conditional requests, local cache reuse, and debounce window) to reduce rate-limit pressure and improve resilience.
- Sidecar updates: Improved version comparison with semantic version parsing to avoid incorrect prompts caused by string comparison.
- UI/Status: Added compatibility-aware sidecar status fields (`latestOverallVersion`, `compatibilityMessage`) and improved overlay messaging when latest overall and latest compatible differ.
- **Console & Chat UI Fixes**: Resolved an issue where the Console tab would lose history when switching views or restarting the drawer. Also fixed the "Jump to latest" button positioning to ensure it stays pinned to the bottom of the chat.
- **Streaming Architecture Uplift**: Added a global stream hub with a single long-lived sidecar subscription and fanout to chat, orchestrator, and Ralph.
- **Event Envelope v2**: Added additive `sidecar_event_v2` envelopes (`event_id`, `correlation_id`, `ts_ms`, `session_id`, `source`, `payload`) while preserving legacy `sidecar_event`.
- **Stream Health Visibility**: Added explicit stream health signaling (`healthy`, `degraded`, `recovering`) and surfaced status in chat.
- **Duplicate/Race Reduction**: Refactored `send_message_streaming` to send-only and moved event relay responsibility to the global stream hub.
- **Reliable Frontend Reconciliation**: Added frontend stream dedupe keyed by `event_id` and wired missing `memory_retrieval` event handling.
- **Busy-Agent Queue UX**: Added message queue support while generation is active (enqueue on Enter + queue preview with send-next/send-all/remove).
- **Process Summary UX**: Upgraded assistant tool-call summary cards with compact process status, step counts, running/pending/failed counts, and duration.
- **Skills Lifecycle Upgrade**: Added import preview + apply flow for SKILL.md/zip packs with deterministic conflict policies (`skip`, `overwrite`, `rename`).
- **Skills Metadata Expansion**: Surfaced richer skill metadata (`version`, `author`, `tags`, `requires`, `compatibility`, `triggers`) and better invalid-skill parse feedback.

## v0.2.19 (2026-02-11)

- Memory: Chat now runs vector retrieval in both standard and streaming send paths, injects `<memory_context>` when relevant, and emits verifiable retrieval telemetry events.
- Memory: Assistant responses now include a colored memory capsule with a brain icon (`used/not used`, chunk count, latency) so retrieval usage is visible per response.
- Logs: Memory retrieval logs now use a distinct `tandem.memory` signal with structured fields (status, chunk tier counts, latency, score range, short query hash) and no raw prompt/chunk content.
- Logs/Console: Reworked Logs drawer tabs to focus on Tandem logs + Console activity (removed redundant OC sidecar tab in this view).
- UI: Logs drawer fullscreen now uses dynamic height correctly instead of staying constrained to the initial panel height.
- Stability: Sidecar lifecycle start/stop is serialized to prevent duplicate OpenCode/Bun instances from race conditions.
- Theme: Improved Pink Pony readability by increasing contrast and reducing problematic translucency.

## v0.2.18 (2026-02-10)

- Files (WIP): Attempted auto-refresh of the Files tree when tools/AI create new files, but it is still unreliable and needs deeper investigation. For now, you may need to switch away and back to Files to see new items.
- Files: File preview now supports a dock mount + fullscreen toggle.
- Python: Enforce venv-only python/pip usage across tool approval and staged/batch execution paths.
- Python: When Python is blocked by venv policy, Tandem auto-opens the Python Setup (Workspace Venv) wizard.
- Packs (Python): Add `requirements.txt` and update START_HERE docs to install dependencies into the workspace venv (no global `pip install`).
- Dev: Add a "Python Packs Standard" to `CONTRIBUTING.md` and ship pack-level `CONTRIBUTING.md` where relevant.

## v0.2.17 (2026-02-10)

- Backgrounds: Fix opacity slider flashing/disappearing in some packaged builds by keeping the resolved image URL stable and updating only opacity.
- Backgrounds: Render custom background image as a dedicated fixed layer for more reliable stacking across views.

## v0.2.16 (2026-02-10)

- Updates: Fix the in-app update prompt layout being constrained/squished due to theme background layering CSS.

## v0.2.15 (2026-02-10)

- Backgrounds: Fix custom background images failing to load in some packaged builds by falling back to an in-memory `data:` URL when the `asset:` URL fails.

## v0.2.14 (2026-02-10)

- Themes: Cosmic Glass now has a denser starfield + galaxy glow background.
- Themes: Pink Pony now features a thick, arcing rainbow background.
- Themes: Zen Dusk now uses a minimalist ink + sage haze background.
- Backgrounds: Add an optional custom background image overlay (copied into app data) with an opacity slider in Settings.
- UI: Gradient theme backgrounds now render consistently across main views and overlays (fixes occasional overlay "shine through").
- Sessions: Fix restored sessions appearing selected but not opening until reselecting the folder (defer history load until the sidecar is running; allow re-clicking the selected session to reload).
- Files: Add Rust-based text extraction for common document formats (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX/XLS/ODS/XLSB, RTF) via `read_file_text`, so these attachments can be previewed and included as usable text in skills/chats without requiring Python.
- Python: Add a workspace-scoped venv wizard (creates `.opencode/.venv` and installs requirements into it) and enforce venv-only python/pip usage for AI tool calls to prevent global installs.
- Navigation: Restore Settings/About/Extensions views after a regression where they would not appear.
- Packs: Style runtime requirement pills consistently.

## v0.2.13 (2026-02-10)

- Skills: Add two new bundled starter skills: `brainstorming` and `development-estimation`.
- Skills: Show runtime requirement pills on starter skill cards via optional `requires: [...]` YAML frontmatter.
- Skills: Improve Skills install/manage UX (runtime note, clearer installed-skill counts, and jump-to-installed).
- Packs: Packs page now shows packs only (remove starter skills section) and moves the runtime note to the top.
- Diagnostics: Improve Logs viewer UX (fullscreen + copy feedback); fix an invalid bundled skill template frontmatter that was being skipped.
- Dev: In `tauri dev`, load starter skill templates from `src-tauri/resources/skill-templates/` so newly added templates appear immediately.
- Docs: Add a developer guide for adding skills in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## v0.2.12 (2026-02-09)

- Orchestrator: Persist the selected provider/model on runs and prefer it when sending prompts, so runs don't start without an explicit model spec.
- Orchestrator: Prevent empty plans from being treated as "Completed"; make Restart rerun completed plans and re-plan when needed.
- Orchestrator: Allow deleting orchestrator runs from the Sessions sidebar (removes the run from disk and deletes its backing OpenCode session).
- Diagnostics: Improve in-app Logs drawer sharing UX (horizontal scroll for long lines, selected-line preview, and copy helpers).
- Release: Fix Discord release notifications for automated releases (publish via `GITHUB_TOKEN` doesn't trigger `release: published` workflows).

## v0.2.11 (2026-02-09)

- OpenCode: Prevent sessions from getting stuck indefinitely when a tool invocation never reaches a terminal state (ignore heartbeat/diff noise, treat more tool terminal statuses as `ToolEnd`, and add a fail-fast timeout that cancels the request and surfaces an error).
- Diagnostics: Add an on-demand Logs drawer that can tail Tandem app logs and show OpenCode sidecar stdout/stderr (captured into a bounded in-memory buffer). Streaming only runs while the viewer is open.
- Reliability: Ignore OpenCode `server.*` heartbeat SSE events (and downgrade other unknown SSE events) to prevent warning spam in logs.
- Providers: Add Poe as an OpenAI-compatible provider option (endpoint + `POE_API_KEY`). Thanks [@CamNoob](https://github.com/CamNoob).
- Release: Retry GitHub Release asset uploads to reduce flakes during transient GitHub errors.

## v0.2.10 (Failed Release, 2026-02-09)

- Release attempt failed due to GitHub release asset upload errors during a GitHub incident; no assets were published. v0.2.11 re-cuts the same changes.

## v0.2.9 (2026-02-09)

- Memory: Incremental per-project workspace file indexing with percent progress, auto-index toggle, and a "Clear File Index" action to reclaim space.
- Memory: Vector Database Stats now supports All Projects vs Active Project scope.
- OpenCode: Properly handle question prompts (multi-question wizard with multiple-choice + custom answers).
- Sessions: On startup, automatically load session history for the last active folder (fixes empty sidebar until a manual refresh).
- Windows: Prevent orphaned OpenCode sidecar (and Bun) processes during `pnpm tauri dev` rebuilds by attaching the sidecar to a Job Object (kill-on-close).

## v0.2.8 (2026-02-09)

- Support multiple custom OpenCode providers by name: Tandem now lets you select arbitrary providers from the sidecar catalog (not just the built-in list) and persists the selection for routing.

## v0.2.7 (2026-02-08)

- Fix OpenCode config writes so existing `opencode.json` is not deleted if replacement fails (Windows-safe).
- Reduce sidecar idle memory usage with Bun/JSC environment hints.

## v0.2.6 (2026-02-08)

- Fix macOS release builds by disabling signing/notarization by default (can be enabled via `MACOS_SIGNING_ENABLED=true`).

## v0.2.5 (2026-02-08)

- Re-cut release to ensure CI/release builds run with the corrected GitHub Actions workflow.

## v0.2.4 (2026-02-08)

- Fixed onboarding getting stuck for Custom providers (e.g. LM Studio) and bouncing users back to Settings.
- Added Vector DB stats + manual workspace indexing in Settings.
- Improved macOS release workflow with optional signing/notarization inputs and CI Gatekeeper verification.

## v0.2.3 (2026-02-08)

- Fixed Orchestration Mode creating endless new root chat sessions during execution.
